Feet \u00b6 \u00be\u2033 (M4 X 20), *-Foot_2018, screw and lock nut, leg rail. Insert the previously cut Leg into the Foot Bottom and loosely add the \u00be\u2033 (M4 X 20) screw and lock nut. This will get tightened during the final step. Bottom Corner and Lock Corner \u00b6 Bottom_Corner and Lock_Corner parts or BottomM_Corner and LockM_Corner, \u00be\u2033 (M4 X 20) Scew and nut, optional Cyanoacrylate Glue. Use the matching Bottom_Corner and Lock_Corner parts or BottomM_Corner and LockM_Corner parts. The direction of the letter will match when assembled of the correct set. Optional but suggested, add some glue to these parts before screwing together for added rigidity. Put the screw \u00be\u2033 (M4 X 20) in from the corner piece and the nut into the lock, and hold with a socket or pliers. This screw can get snugged down. Leg Assembly \u00b6 \u00be\u2033 (M4 X 20) screw and nut, previous assemblies. Assemble the corners on to the Bottoms, add the screw \u00be\u2033 (M4 X 20) and nut (nut goes in the hex shaped hole). Leave these screws loose, they will get snugged up in the final step. Repeat this for all four sets. Roller Assembly - Fixed Bearings \u00b6 Use the 1.25\u2033 (M8 X 30) bolts, lock nuts, 608 bearings, and the Roller or RollerM. Nuts are best facing towards each other, unless you plan on adding mid span supports then the other way could get you some extra clearance. These can get snugged up, don\u2019t crack the plastic , just snug. Do this for all 4 sets. Roller Assembly - Tension Bolts \u00b6 2.5\u2033 (M8 X 65) bolt, 608 Bearings, Roller or Dual plates. Use the 2.5\u2033 (M8 X 65) bolt, run it through the Roller Plate (or the dual plates ). After the Roller plate add a 608 bearing. Add the plate and bearing stack into the Roller from the single bearing side. Only part way Add a Bearing into the center of the roller, and thread the bolt the rest of the way into the roller. Pay attention to the direction of the plate, the stand offs should face the bearings , and the extra notches should face the single bearing. Rollers on Rails \u00b6 Previous assemblies, 5/16\u201d (M8) Nylock nuts, X or Y rail. The nut for the 2.5\u2033 (M8 X 65) bolt should be left extremely loose almost touching the roller but not all the way. Make sure these nuts don\u2019t interfere with the small nut slots, if they do put the small nuts in now. Put all the rollers on their rails and make sure they all slide equally well. There should be tension when inserting the rail and all the bearings should touch. Roller Matched Pairs \u00b6 This is showing the pairs for the X and Y axis. It should be one Roller and one RollerM. It does not matter which way the gantry rail angle is facing as long as it is facing the same as its counterpart. Roller and RollerM are just a mirrored set, made to help with printer deficiencies. Each axis gets one of each and the need to look mirrored (angle on the same side). When using the optional Dual plates, the long side should face X0 Y0 (nearest left corner) Lower Corner Assembly \u00b6 Previous assemblies, Spacer_corners Add your Y rails and rollers to the corner assemblies (front to back axes). Make sure the angled belt brackets face out, and the angles are pointed towards each other. Lay a Spacer_Corner on the rail. Lay the X rail and rollers on next (Right to left axes). Full Corner Assembly \u00b6 Top_Corner pieces, \u00be\u2033 (M4 X 20) screws, and nuts. Put on the Top_Corner pieces. Make sure the brackets are facing out, and the angles towards each other. Add the four screws \u00be\u2033 (M4 X 20), and nuts. Leave the screws loose. Assemble all the corners. There will be a 2+mm gap all the way around. Check Base Dimensions \u00b6 Set all your outer dimensions from corner to corner, Usually this is the same as your x and Y Rail length that was entered into the calculator . Lightly snug up the Top_Corner screws trying to keep the spacing even on all four sides of the part. The parts do not require very much torque the design holds the rails well. There will be a 2mm+ gap all the way around. Double check your dimensions, Be as accurate as possible.","title":"Corners, Rollers, Base"},{"location":"mpcnc/base/#base","text":"Warning These documents are not yet the official documents.

Please go to v1engineering.com for the up to date and accurate instructions. at v1engineering.com This is an intermediate walk through on 2.5D routing with ESTLCAM . You should have a firm grasp on the basics before trying this. This is how to manually set up a 2.5D cut, the alternative would be to import an STL file and let ESTLCAM choose the paths. The automatically generated STL paths took 50 minutes to cut and did not pick up the small 4mm hole. The following manual paths took 18 minutes to cut and look fantastic! So I can show some different techniques in this walk though I am using piece of Brazilian Ipe that has an uneven top surface, so no reliable Z origin. I will use the bed as the start position and tell ESTLCAM the work surface is slightly higher than measured on the thickest part of the wood. This will allow me to easily surface the uneven wood and not have to estimate where the origin should be. The tool paths start with importing the DXF file in mm. This file has all the part paths on it but not the depth of cut so we will work though this on step at a time. The tool will be starting off to the left of the actual piece of wood touching the bed so the first step is to move the zero point over about half an inch, to approximate where the tool will start. Just select Zero, Point, and Click where you want the new Zero. These are the dimension I will be using for the depths of cut. The first cutting step will be the basic surfacing of the wood to make sure the top is nice and flush. I don\u2019t have much thickness to spare so for surfacing I am only cutting 1.55mm in to the work surface. Because I am starting from the bed the Z origin will be set at the end when ESTLCAM asks for the part height, that will be the Z zero plane (I will be using 11.5mm). So for this part my Z=0 will be 11.5mm from the bed surface. If you had a nice flat piece of material you can make it easier and just start at the work surface. For the cut I select Inside, pocket , and selected the outer most path, shown in red. Make sure to set the tool path depth and machining order starting at one and increment by at least one. The next cut will be a pocket taking the whole surface down in 2 steps, a rough and finishing pass. For the roughing we can start at 1.55mm from the Z=0 plane since that material is already gone from the previous step and go into the material another 4.85mm as see in the part dimensions. For the roughing pass we will leave an allowance of 0.2mm. This lets us come back round for a second pass and only have to mill of .2mm of wood and this leaves a nice smooth Finished surface. So we use an inside pocket pass with .2mm allowance and then a second just inside cut with 0 allowance since the material has already been removed with the roughing pocket no need to cut all that empty space. Current tool path shown in red. Again, always set the machining order. This new pocket will be the depth at which we start the rest of the cuts (6.4mm) Next will be the 4mm hole. We can use a Helical path and start from 6.4mm deep and go a little into the spoil board, I went an extra .2mm for a cut of 5.3mm Now 3 more inside cuts, rough pockets followed by finishing passes. Now that the inner features have been finished it is time to cut the part from the material, leaving 3 small tabs that can easily but snipped off. For this step will will be using an outside cut, with a .2mm allowance, setting the tabs, starting at the Z=0 plane since the outer edge did not get surfaced and cutting .2mm in to the waste board (11.7mm deep). Then the finishing pass with 0 allowance and matching the tabs previously set. Now save your project in case you need to come back and edit your paths. You can do this by using the select tool and changing the popup box parameters. Then export your CNC program (gcode). I use repetier as my visualizer to make sure the cuts look like they should, but to catch small errors if you are new to this I always suggest cutting into high density foam the first run to test your path. Better to waste some time and foam them stress your machine, break a bit, and waste material with some bad gcode. This leaves me with fairly finished part. I can pop it out and use a razor knife to cut off the tabs. I then hit the edges lightly with some 220 git sand paper and call it a day. Here are the files I used, you will probably need to edit these unless your wood is 11.5mm thick. This is the DXF, My generated gcode, and my estlcam project file.

Please go to v1engineering.com for the up to date and accurate instructions. at v1engineering.com Estlcam is found here. EstlCAM is for generating GCode. This software seems to do everything I want. It also seems to be translated into every language I\u2019ve ever heard of, if not you can add translations in the software. The installer is in German I think but the options are easy to understand. Please buy a copy if you find this works for you. Step one \u2013 Install Estlcam \u00b6 Install Estlcam. Using the default options in the installer, add Icon to start menu and desktop. The first window that pops up I set the language, change the display units, and set it to show the feed rate in mm/s on the tool popups. After you click okay close Estlcam and restart it to update the settings. Step 2 \u2013 Setup \u00b6 After restarting Estlcam, open the setup tab, these are the settings from the first window plus a few extra. Changing the clearance plane to something a little smaller really speeds up a job since the z axis is the slowest. This is how far above the material it should travel to before it moves. You should change the milling direction depending on what kind of material you are cutting, more on this in another post. Setting the z-axis origin to the top of the material makes it easy to set the home position, along with that is program start \u2013 at origin. Choosing to end the program \u201cabove origin\u201d is safe, \u201cabove last position\u201d is the fastest. The creator of Estlcam recently updated his software for us! In the CNC Program Generation tab, choose Marlin (if you are using my firmware). Important \u2013 Set feed unit to mm/min- (this is what the marlin firmware needs). Change the file extension \u201cgcode\u201d so all the programs recognize it. Next up is the travel feed rates. 2100/60=35mm/s, 480=8mm/s (keep the Z low) I delete all the default tools and use this as a conservative test speed setting for an \u215b\u2033 flat endmill in wood. Do not exceed 8mm/s in the z plunge field unless you know what you are doing and know what firmware limits you have. You are ready to generate some GCode. Step 3 \u2013 2D gcode, Good for pen plotting or 2D milling (cutting things out) \u00b6 Grid Size. DXF files are crazy sizes sometimes so to make sure your DXF is the right size change the grid. Found in View>Grid I set mine to 10mm or 25.4mm=1in. For this 2D or 2.5D work .DXF files are used. You can use any vector program to make them, illustrator, SolidWorks, etc. Get some files from here, (Need a new source, sorry). I used this one in the video , Crown Vector . Open DXF.

Zero>Create arbitrary point , then select outside of the DXF paths. This is how to set your origin (or Home). The little blue plus symbol is what your machine sees as 0,0 (x=0, y=0, generally the lower left corner of your work). When you start your program the machine will work to the right and above where you start it from (represented by the blue plus). Some people like to work from the center for round or oval objects. Step 5 \u2013 Select the tool paths \u00b6 To use the pen you want to drawn on the line so use engrave (tool centered on line), if you were cutting a part you can choose part (tool edge on the outside of line), or cutout (tool edge in inside of line). Click Engrave then just click on each line segment. Step 6 \u2013 Save \u00b6 Export. File>Save CNC Program . Give it a name. You will get a depth popup, for the pen I use 1mm or less, anything else set it to the thickness of your material plus a bit to cut all the way through. You can then preview the path. Step 7 \u2013 Control Software \u00b6 Open repetier-host . load the .gcode (or .nc , .ngc) file you just saved. If you have the bed size adjusted you can get a sense of scale. If you can\u2019t see the lines check the box Print Preview>Show Travel moves. View it from the edge and you can see, that the path is below your z-home, and the movements are above z-home. Don\u2019t pay any attention as to where it is shown on the bed. It will start where ever your head currently is. Step 8 \u00b6 Start. Put the tip of the pen (or tool) a hair above where you want it to start and hit run. It should pick up, move, drop down and go. If it goes down first and doesn\u2019t pick up between moves your z axis is backwards. Flip the plug .

Final \u00b6 This all it takes to plot with a pen or do basic 2D (2.5D) milling, some of the most common things this type of mill is used for. Make sure to adjust your tool and its settings depending on the material in use. Always do a test cut! Here is an old video, the new pen holder has a built in spring so you will get even more consistent results.","title":"EstlCAM Basics"},{"location":"software/estlcam-basics/#estlcam-basics","text":"Warning These documents are not yet the official documents.

Changing the clearance plane to something a little smaller really speeds up a job since the z axis is the slowest. This is how far above the material it should travel to before it moves. You should change the milling direction depending on what kind of material you are cutting, more on this in another post. Setting the z-axis origin to the top of the material makes it easy to set the home position, along with that is program start \u2013 at origin. Choosing to end the program \u201cabove origin\u201d is safe, \u201cabove last position\u201d is the fastest. The creator of Estlcam recently updated his software for us! In the CNC Program Generation tab, choose Marlin (if you are using my firmware). Important \u2013 Set feed unit to mm/min- (this is what the marlin firmware needs). Change the file extension \u201cgcode\u201d so all the programs recognize it. Next up is the travel feed rates. 2100/60=35mm/s, 480=8mm/s (keep the Z low) I delete all the default tools and use this as a conservative test speed setting for an \u215b\u2033 flat endmill in wood. Do not exceed 8mm/s in the z plunge field unless you know what you are doing and know what firmware limits you have. You are ready to generate some GCode.","title":"Step 2 \u2013 Setup"},{"location":"software/estlcam-basics/#step-3-2d-gcode-good-for-pen-plotting-or-2d-milling-cutting-things-out","text":"Grid Size.
