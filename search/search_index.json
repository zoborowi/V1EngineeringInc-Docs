Since day one I have never encouraged endstops be used, until now. The Mostly Printed CNC and LowRider CNC are unique in the fact that two of the axes are powered at each end of the axis. Using this fact and the new dual endstop firmware we can now more precisely and accurately set the position of every single stepper on the machine independently. This should reliably give you repeat-ability on the order of your endstops resolution, even after powering off. Before this new firmware update all the machines in this category relied 100% on the users build accuracy, or manual measuring. This involves setting of each axis before engaging the steppers and locking it in place. If the steppers are ever disengaged during use only the side of the axis with an endstop can accurately be accounted for. This makes fixturing, tool changes, and multi-day jobs extremely difficult to get repeatable results. A poor build or lack of axis alignment before each job will result in a non square skewed axis. A skewed axis will result in ovals and parallelograms instead of circles and 90\u00b0 cornered rectangles. Changes in build accuracy due to use and environmental conditions need to be adjusted out or accounted for manually. Now just a minor offset adjustment will correct this. Plugging In The Steppers \u00b6 Remapping of pins is used in the firmware to allow the use of all the control boards drivers. The unused extruder driver/s are used for the extra stepper/s. Ramps \u00b6 Mini-RAMBo \u00b6 This board only has 4 drivers available and can easily be used with the LowRider CNC but can not full take advantage of the new firmware with the MPCNC. Archim \u00b6 RAMBo \u00b6 Endstops \u00b6 The min pins are used as normal for the first stepper and the max pins are used for the second stepper on that axis, still as a min. For example, X1 pairs with Xmin, X2 pairs with Xmax. DO NOT USE THE + (positive) Terminal. S & \u2013 (signal and Negative) Only Xmin=X1 limit switch Xmax=X2 limit switch Ymin=Y1 limit Switch Ymax=Y2 Limit switch Zmin=Touch probe. Signal pin to plate, negative to tool. For the safest configuration the endstops should be wired in the Normally Closed position (NC), to prevent wire disconnects from damaging the machine during the homing sequence. Mechanical endstops are connected to the signal and ground pins filtered or optical endstops use all three pins, connect these with extreme caution. Using the wrongs pins will damage your control board. Optical endstops are not recommended on a machine used for milling or routing. The debris can inhibit there function. I made modified a few parts to keep the wiring clean, Clean Dual Mounts . Mini-RAMBo \u00b6 This board only has 4 drivers available and can easily be used with the LowRider CNC (Y axis) but can not full take advantage of the new firmware with the MPCNC. RAMBo \u00b6 Pay attention the pins are opposite each other, but clearly labeled on the board. Archim \u00b6 Ramps \u00b6 Firmware \u00b6 The dual endstop firmware is on the V1 Engineering Marlin GitHub page. Remember small 1mm moves when initially powering it up, if driving your steppers the wrong way you can rip your machine apart. If your steppers are moving the wrong direction, completely power off your board before flipping the plug over. In case you have never used GitHub, the first drop down lets you select the firmware version you want. The next step is download the firmware you selected. Click on \u201cClone or Download\u201d, then click on \u201cDownload Zip\u201d. Testing and Calibration \u00b6 After all the endstops have been connected issuing a M119 command will let you see the current status of each endstop. You should check that each endstop registers both an open and closed status before proceeding. Open when not touching and closed when they are. You can test them individually by closing each one by hand and running an M119 . Also verify the X1 corresponds to the X1 stepper. Then verify a positive movement is away from the end stops. The unfortunately designated M666 lets you test your offset to quickly calibrate your machine. Using the command M666 X0.72 would offset the X1 stepper 0.72mm away from it\u2019s endstop, Y! can also be used. To verify your current settings during calibration just an M666 will show the current offsets. Once the correct offset are found you should input them into your firmware. This is to simplify the actual placement of the endstops themselves, you only need to get them such that the X1 or Y1 endstop is at or slightly behind where it needs to be within a few Millimeters is best. You can verify how square your axis is by measuring the diagonals of the largest rectangle you can draw in your build area. The larger the more accurate\u2026but also harder to measure. I only have 6\u2033 calipers but I was more accurate with a tape measure at my 440mm available diagonal. Measure the diagonals to the X1 and Y1 endstops blocks. Offset the endstop that has the short dimension by the amount it is short or just a hair over. So if the X1 diagonal was 1mm short you would offset X1 by 1mm. M666 X1. Tip \u2013 If it is more than 2mm off move the stop block, each belt tooth is 2mm. Draw a fresh one to verify. If that is correct you should edit your firmware to make this change permanent in configuration.h Or add it to all of your Gcode. Enjoy! Care should be taken to use as little pen pressure as possible with the finest tip possible to get the most accurate results and a pen mount with some give should be used, example pen mount . My trials and tribulations figuring this out\u2026.Feel free to make fun of me. Forum link . Use \u00b6 First, most jobs will not benefit from using endstops. Getting the machine close and just running a quick one off carving or sign has no need to go through all the extra steps. People new to the CNC world should not use this, this is a advanced technique. My support for this will be limited. You can now use the machine in two ways. Quick one off jobs as you always would setting the home position by hand and just running the job. Or by starting each job with a G28 (if using a touch plate) you can now reference or return to that position at any time. If you are not using a touch plate you can use G28 X Y You can use fixtures at a set reference points on the table to do repeat jobs or multiple sided cuts utilizing CAM based work offsets or scripts. Tool changes can be done with multiple gcodes so you can do repeat jobs in order of bit used instead of per piece depending on if changing the part of the bit is the faster choice. Jobs can be restarted in case of power outage, tool breaks, long multi day jobs, apply paint between cuts, etc. If you don\u2019t need the endstops you can just insert the command, G92 X0 Y0 Z0 , in your gcode before the cut starts. This should allow for normal use without homing or work offsets, also no squaring. For more info please see the Milling Basics page. Work offsets \u00b6 Make sure your job has a work offset if you use the endstops. A typical part has the gcode built with the origin at the parts corner. If you where to cut out that part it would result in going negative past your endstops and misalign your machine. Negative moves do not work on the X and Y axis with endstops. Moving the origin in your CAM program is the easiest fix. To get a more precise work offset it is best to add it in your CAD file. This can be done with a bounding box, cut it as a separate path and used to position your material. How it is done in the firmware \u00b6 Marlin currently has to have at least one extruder defined, this extruder causes us an issue has we need the driver it is assigned to. All boards have and E0 driver (some call it something different), and dual firmware capable boards also have an E1 driver, beyond that most boards have breakout pins for more external drivers. The first extruder gets assigned to driver E0. To make this all work I change pin assignments for E0 to one of the external break pins change the current E1 pins to the E0 driver, and create an E2 set and assign them the pins of the E1 driver. I hope that makes sense, I move E0 pin assingments out of the way and shuffle E1 and E2 down one slot. All of this happens in the Pins/Pins_XXXX.h files. XXXX=whatever board you are using.","title":"Dual Endstops"},{"location":"electronics/dual-endstops/#auto-square-dual-endstops","text":"","title":"Auto Square, Dual EndStops"},{"location":"electronics/dual-endstops/#basics","text":"The Dual EndStop firmware update enables unprecedented precision more easily than ever before.

For the safest configuration the endstops should be wired in the Normally Closed position (NC), to prevent wire disconnects from damaging the machine during the homing sequence. Mechanical endstops are connected to the signal and ground pins filtered or optical endstops use all three pins, connect these with extreme caution. Using the wrongs pins will damage your control board. Optical endstops are not recommended on a machine used for milling or routing. The debris can inhibit there function.

You should check that each endstop registers both an open and closed status before proceeding. Open when not touching and closed when they are. You can test them individually by closing each one by hand and running an M119 . Also verify the X1 corresponds to the X1 stepper. Then verify a positive movement is away from the end stops. The unfortunately designated M666 lets you test your offset to quickly calibrate your machine. Using the command M666 X0.72 would offset the X1 stepper 0.72mm away from it\u2019s endstop, Y! can also be used. To verify your current settings during calibration just an M666 will show the current offsets. Once the correct offset are found you should input them into your firmware. This is to simplify the actual placement of the endstops themselves, you only need to get them such that the X1 or Y1 endstop is at or slightly behind where it needs to be within a few Millimeters is best. You can verify how square your axis is by measuring the diagonals of the largest rectangle you can draw in your build area. The larger the more accurate\u2026but also harder to measure. I only have 6\u2033 calipers but I was more accurate with a tape measure at my 440mm available diagonal. Measure the diagonals to the X1 and Y1 endstops blocks. Offset the endstop that has the short dimension by the amount it is short or just a hair over. So if the X1 diagonal was 1mm short you would offset X1 by 1mm. M666 X1. Tip \u2013 If it is more than 2mm off move the stop block, each belt tooth is 2mm. Draw a fresh one to verify. If that is correct you should edit your firmware to make this change permanent in configuration.h Or add it to all of your Gcode. Enjoy! Care should be taken to use as little pen pressure as possible with the finest tip possible to get the most accurate results and a pen mount with some give should be used, example pen mount .

Getting the machine close and just running a quick one off carving or sign has no need to go through all the extra steps. People new to the CNC world should not use this, this is a advanced technique. My support for this will be limited. You can now use the machine in two ways. Quick one off jobs as you always would setting the home position by hand and just running the job. Or by starting each job with a G28 (if using a touch plate) you can now reference or return to that position at any time. If you are not using a touch plate you can use G28 X Y You can use fixtures at a set reference points on the table to do repeat jobs or multiple sided cuts utilizing CAM based work offsets or scripts. Tool changes can be done with multiple gcodes so you can do repeat jobs in order of bit used instead of per piece depending on if changing the part of the bit is the faster choice. Jobs can be restarted in case of power outage, tool breaks, long multi day jobs, apply paint between cuts, etc. If you don\u2019t need the endstops you can just insert the command, G92 X0 Y0 Z0 , in your gcode before the cut starts. This should allow for normal use without homing or work offsets, also no squaring. For more info please see the Milling Basics page.","title":"Use"},{"location":"electronics/dual-endstops/#work-offsets","text":"Make sure your job has a work offset if you use the endstops. A typical part has the gcode built with the origin at the parts corner. If you where to cut out that part it would result in going negative past your endstops and misalign your machine. Negative moves do not work on the X and Y axis with endstops. Moving the origin in your CAM program is the easiest fix. To get a more precise work offset it is best to add it in your CAD file. This can be done with a bounding box, cut it as a separate path and used to position your material.","title":"Work offsets"},{"location":"electronics/dual-endstops/#how-it-is-done-in-the-firmware","text":"Marlin currently has to have at least one extruder defined, this extruder causes us an issue has we need the driver it is assigned to.

The first extruder gets assigned to driver E0. To make this all work I change pin assignments for E0 to one of the external break pins change the current E1 pins to the E0 driver, and create an E2 set and assign them the pins of the E1 driver.

When you turn on the machine, where ever it starts is the start line. If you use the LCD or computer to move it, you are moving away from the start point, but the start point is in the same place it was. When you start the race, you have to return to the start line. Zeroing out your coordinates moves the start line to where you currently are. Exactly. Setting the zero, or the \u201corigin\u201d is important so your machine knows where to start the job. Equally important is that the directions you move are going the right way. X, Y, and Z may seem arbitrary to you, but they are not (but they are a bit flexible). We\u2019ll talk about the three axis, and their directions in Coordinate Directions . Coordinates are used with every job, and it is important to set them right. Origin \u00b6 The \u201cOrigin\u201d or \u201cHome\u201d or \u201cZero\u201d is the single place where the X,Y and Z coordinates are equal to 0.000. This can be anywhere. It is set in your CAM, and then when you set up your job, you will tell the controller where you want it so the rest of the cut is in the right place. Here is an example: You design a simple shape, a 10mm square. In CAM, you choose to cut 10mm deep. You set the origin in CAM to be at the top of the workpiece, and the lower left corner of the design. On your machine, you bolt down your work, install the bit, all that stuff. You then jog to the lower left corner of your work. You adjust the Z so the bit is just touching the top surface of the material. You now Set the origin to this location . Start the router, play the g-code file, and the box is cut down 10mm from where you started, and 10mm to the up and right. Warning If you hadn\u2019t set the origin. The machine would have just assumed wherever it started was the origin. That can lead to the first thing it does is just crash through your workpiece, crash through your spoil board, and try to get back to where it started. Not a fun day! Origin Locations \u00b6 Just to make this easier, there are just a few origin locations that make sense. Lower, Left, Top \u00b6 If you\u2019re cutting a flat part out of an oversized piece of material, this is the best way to go. You just put the origin near the lower left area of the material, and it will cut from that corner. It won\u2019t be easy to center it in the material, but that is OK. Center, Top \u00b6 If you are carving a logo, or some art, into the top of an existing workpiece, you might consider centering the XY location of the origin. For example, if you are carving a logo in a cabinet door. In this case, center the origin in CAM, and make sure the design is scaled to a size you like. Mark the center of your door, and set the origin there. The benefit of this option is that the ultimate carving will stay centered. It is easy to accidentally go over the edge of material if it is scaled wrong, which is why the LLT origin is better for new parts. Bottom Z \u00b6 Setting the origin to the top of the material means you will start at 0, and then move down into the negative coordinates to reach through the material you are cutting. If that doesn\u2019t make sense to you, you can also set the Z=0 to be the top of your spoil board, and start milling starting at the top of the workpiece. This isn\u2019t very common though, because the spoil board isn\u2019t as important (usually) as your work material, so getting it aligned with the top of the material is more useful. Setting the Origin \u00b6 There are different ways to set the origin. Each way has it\u2019s own pros/cons. Using LCD \u00b6 If you have an LCD with your controller, you can use the menus to move the tool to the origin that you want. Once there, select the \u201cSet Home Position\u201d in the menus. Using Repetier Host \u00b6 Similar to the LCD method, use Repetier Host\u2019s controls to jog to the desired origin location, and then send a G92 X0 Y0 Z0 to set the origin. You also need to send a @isathome to reset Repetier\u2019s idea of where it is. Using Starting G-Code \u00b6 If you have your CAM software add in a G92 X0 Y0 Z0 at the start of the gcode file, then wherever you start your code will be the origin, because the first thing it will do is set the origin. This is what is done in the test crown, and it works pretty well, as long as you know it is there. Warning Be sure to pay attention to which files have this and which don\u2019t. It can be pretty easy to assume a file has this command, and forget to set the origin, and then watch it take off towards it\u2019s starting location. Alternatively, if you set the origin, and forget the gcode has a G92, then job somewhere else to start the job, it may be cutting air, and confusing you. Move the Gantry by Hand \u00b6 On an MPCNC, when the power is off, you can usually move the gantry by just pushing it to where you want it to go. Once you\u2019re at the origin you want, you can just turn on the controller and enable the steppers. Warning Moving the steppers too fast will generate current, which goes back into the controller. If you are moving them fast enough for the lights to turn on in the controller, you are in danger of turning your controller to smoke. Warning This doesn\u2019t work with some MPCNCs with large routers or the Low Rider. If the gantry falls on it\u2019s own, then you can\u2019t easily set the Z. Info You can also use the LCD or Repetier Host to move the gantry under power. When you\u2019re there, you can just reset the controller to reset the origin. Using XY Endstops (Single or Dual) \u00b6 Option 1 \u00b6 Set the origin in you CAM to be the location of the endstops. Then put your material in the right place relative to your machine. The Z needs to be set separately. Option 2 \u00b6 Home the X and Y. You can then move to the desired origin by jogging the machine. When you get there, write down the current coordinates, and Set the home position. If you turn off the machine or lose your location, you can home again, and then jog to the coordinates you wrote down. Using Z Touch Plate \u00b6 Using one of the above methods, set your origin, and then jog the Z up. Attach your touch plate and home the Z. This can be done in these ways: Home Z in the LCD menu. Home Z button in Repetier-Host. G28 Z from the console. Info You can do this at any X or Y location you\u2019d like. If you\u2019re carving, you might want to probe near the middle of the workpiece so that you minimize the total error. But make sure you go back to X,Y zero before resetting the Z. Now, you need to remove the offset from the Touch plate. There are a couple of ways to do that too: Warning Don\u2019t forget to remove the touch plate before continuing. Jog the machine down the thickness of the touch plate and set the origin. Send a G92 Z0.5 to set the current position to 0.5mm. If your touch plate is a different thickness, use that thicknes. Coordinate Directions \u00b6 When you\u2019re setting up the machine, you have some power over the coordinate directions. You can plug the motors into the X, Y, or Z drivers, and you can accidentally or intentionally reverse the plugs (which makes the motors go the other way). Basic Configuration \u00b6 If you just want to have a machine that works, and you don\u2019t care, then test to make sure the machine moves in this way (relative to you, when standing at the front of the machine): Higher X values go to the right. Higher Y values go away from you. Higher Z values go up (away from the spoil board). Info The best way to check the coordinates is to just carefully jog in a single direction at a time. If one of the axis moves the wrong direction, you can reverse the steppers . If two of the axis are swapped, you can move the wires to change the driver. Warning You can destroy your drivers if the steppers are enabled and you disconnect them. Always turn the power off before disconnecting the motors. So, if you\u2019d rather have the wheeled axis be the X and the tubing axis be the Y on your Low Rider, that\u2019s fine. It is your machine, make it work for you. Advanced Configurations \u00b6 If you want a different coordinate frame, then you can have it. But if you don\u2019t want mirrored parts, then you need to follow these rules: The coordinate frame needs to be a \u201cRight Handed\u201d coordinate frame. That is true even if you are left handed or one handed. It has nothing to do with your hands. Here is a reference . Z should be the up/down coordinate. Some features, like arcs, assume you are in the XY plane for most operations.","title":"Coordinates"},{"location":"learn/coordinates/#coordinates-101","text":"","title":"Coordinates 101"},{"location":"learn/coordinates/#introduction","text":"Here is a quote from the forums : Zeroing out your coordinates is like setting the start line in a race.

A .gcode file is just a list of individual commands, which will be processed one at a time. That\u2019s it! There is no magic involved. You can rename a .gcode file with a .txt extension and open it in a text editor (like wordpad). Here are some instructions you might see in a .gcode file: G00 X0.000 Y0.000 Z0.000 F300.00 G01 Z-1.000 F300.00 G01 X10.000 F600.00 Each of these lines is one single command. They are read in by the controller one at a time. If you typed in each of these commands into a console, the machine would work the same as if you played them from a G-Code sender (except, you couldn\u2019t go as fast). So, if we understand what each of these commands do, then we can understand the whole file. But, this just looks like gibberish to me!? This \u201clanguage\u201d is meant to be read by the controller and not by humans. But you don\u2019t have to be a coder to understand it. In fact, there are really just a few commands that we ever use, so it doesn\u2019t take long at all to learn. First G-Code Command \u00b6 G01 X10.000 F600.00 This is a single G-Code command. It starts with the kind of command G01 and then has two parameters X10.000 and F600.00 . G01 This is a G1 command, which means it is a movement command. All G01 does is tell the controller that the parameters are for a movement command. X10.000 When there is a movement command, the X tells the controller to move in the X direction. The number ( 10.000 ) tells the controller how far to move. In this case, it will move the X axis to the 10mm mark. F600.00 When there is a movement command, the F tells the controller how fast to move. In this command, this is 600mm/min, or 10mm/s. So, put it all together and this tells the controller to move to the X=10mm mark, at 10mm/s. In a movement command, X, Y, and Z are all possible. So here is some g-code for moving in a square 10mm on a side, at 10mm/s: G01 X0.000 Y0.000 F600 G01 X10.000 Y0.000 F600 G01 X10.000 Y10.000 F600 G01 X0.000 Y10.000 F600 G01 X0.000 Y0.000 F600 But wait, there are 4 sides on a square, and this is 5 commands! A movement command only describes where to go to . The previous location determines where to move from . To make a line, you need two movement commands. G-Code Variants \u00b6 G-Code is supposed to be a standard. But, it has a lot of uses, and a lot of ways it can be expanded. We use Marlin as controller software, so our g-code needs to be compatible with Marlin. Other CNC machines might use Grbl (which is mostly the same as Marlin) or Mach or LinuxCNC. Each of these has slight variations in the standard. For that reason it is important to look at the Marlin documentation for Gcode: Marlin G-Code Reference Another great g-code reference is the Rep Rap Reference . Just beware that Marlin doesn\u2019t maintain the Rep Rap reference, so even the Marlin specific information may be out of date. Comments \u00b6 Since G-Code isn\u2019t a human language, it is helpful to add in some comments to let people who are reading the code understand what you are saying. Machines will ignore the comments, so you can put anything you want in there. There are two formats for comments: Anything after a semicolon will be a comment. Ex: G01 X10.000 F600.00 ; This is a comment ; This is also a comment. Anything in parenthesis is a comment. Ex: G01 X10.000 F600.00 ( This is a comment ) ( This is also a comment. ) G1 vs. G01 \u00b6 G1 is the same as G01 . Marlin will ignore the extra 0. This is true for most commands. M-codes \u00b6 Some \u201cG-Codes\u201d start with an M . This is just a way to expand the number of commands. Capitalization \u00b6 All the letters should be capitalized. Marlin isn\u2019t looking for lowercase letters, and they look completely different to Marlin, so just use ALL CAPS. Specific G-Codes \u00b6 Here are some G-Codes that we will find very important. G0, G1 - Linear Move \u00b6 Marlin Reference If you don\u2019t define a speed, the previous speed will be used. G2, G3 - Arc Moves \u00b6 Marlin Reference These have had trouble with some versions of the firmware. Sometimes, it is better to configure your CAM to not use them, and instead, use linear moves to move around an arc. G28 - Home \u00b6 Marlin Reference It is generally only used with a specific axis on the CNC machine. For example: G28 Z ; Homes the Z axis only G90 - Absolute Positioning. \u00b6 Marlin Reference Most of the time, your movement commands will be in absolute coordinates. So make sure this is at the top of your gcode files. G92 - Set Position \u00b6 Marlin Reference M17 - Enable Steppers \u00b6 Marlin Reference M18, M84 - Disable Steppers \u00b6 Marlin Reference Configuration Codes \u00b6 Sometimes, it is useful to type on a console directly with the controller to investigate or to set specific commands.

Motion is the critical task we ask of our machines. Mostly, we don\u2019t worry too much about it, because it just works, but a little bit of understanding can go a long way if you\u2019ve got any issues with your motion. So let\u2019s talk about motion! Motion Background \u00b6 A G00 command is meant to indicate a travel move, or a move where there is no cutting involved. A G01 command is meant to indicate a cutting move. Info Marlin\u2019s main goal is 3D printing, and that makes it a little murky. In 3D printing, any move that doesn\u2019t extrude plastic is a travel move. By default, it doesn\u2019t see a distinction between G00 and G01 . Marlin has it\u2019s own rules for maximum speed, and acceleration. Marlin also supports \u201cjerk\u201d setting, but this isn\u2019t the derivative of the acceleration. You can also set the \u201cJunction Deviation\u201d which replaces jerk. Each command has a \u201cFeedrate\u201d. If you don\u2019t define one, it will just use the previous one. G-Code Feedrate \u00b6 Example G-Code \u00b6 Look at these commands (for more detail, look at the g-code tutorial ): G00 X0.00 Y0.00 Z0.00 G00 X10.00 G01 Z-0.1 F300.00 G01 X100.00 F600 G01 Y100.00 At first, it looks fine. But there is a problem. The first two commands don\u2019t have a feedrate defined. So whatever speed the last command was at, is what is going to be used. At the 3 rd line, we finally set a feedrate. On the 4 th , it is changed to something new, and on the last line, there is no feedrate, so the 600 is used again. Details \u00b6 The feedrates in gcode describe the speed to travel along the line. So, for example, if you were at 0,0 and you were travelling to 100mm,100mm, and the feedrate was set to 100mm/s, it would travel at a speed of 100mm/s, but have 140mm to travel, so it would take about 1.4s to get there. If you sent the same command with a feedrate of 140mm/s, then it would take 1 second to finish that move. The limits on the speeds in Marlin are axis based. So if you set the max speed rate in X to 50mm/s and the max feedrate in Y to 50mm/s, Marlin will slow down this move to not exceed that speed on either axis. So the speed would end up being 70mm/s, and finish in about 2 seconds. So I use these terms in this document: Feedrate The maximum speed along the straight line in gcode. Max Speed The maximum speed along a single axis. Note In the past, some versions of Marlin have not protected against speeds higher than their max. All indications are the current Marlin (V1Engineering 418+) are responding well to adjustments in the max feedrate. Those total timing numbers aren\u2019t completely right. Because Marlin also doesn\u2019t go from a full stop to top speed instantly. It will use the acceleration values to decide how quickly to ramp up the speed to it\u2019s top speed. So this move that takes 2s and maxes out at 50mm/s in each direction will actually take a bit longer, because it will start out slower, and work its way up to 50mm/s. Then at the end, it will slow down before the end of the 100mm, and stop smoothly. You can really see the effect if you drop your accelerations very slow. Movements are more smooth, but they sometimes take a lot longer. The accelerations are also applied on a per axis basis, so on a high speed move, the X axis will be accelerating at it\u2019s max acceleration and the Y will be accelerating at it\u2019s max acceleration. The total acceleration on a compound move will be higher along the line. Jerk, or Junction Deviation are used because even on the corner of a square, you don\u2019t want to stop completely. That will just slow things down more than necessary. These other parameters consider how fast to take a turn. Adjusting Max Speed \u00b6 You can easily change the max speeds and accelerations because they are stored in the EEPROM, and they are read in every time you start (or boot) Marlin. You can change these at any time, but remember to save your changes by writing out to the EEPROM. M203 X30 Y30 Z10 This will set the X and Y speeds to 30mm/s (notice this is in mm/s, whereas feedrates are in mm/min) and the Z to 10mm/s. M500 This will save all the value to the EEPROM. Marlin Reference Generally, the defaults in the V1Engineering firmware are conservative enough for these machines. If you want to go faster and know the consequences, then by all means, change them. If you installed a high steps/mm Z and you need to slow down your Z, then this is a good way to do it. Here is the general rule of thumb for speeds. You shouldn\u2019t allow the machine to go so fast that it skips steps when not cutting material. Friction in the machine, or loss of torque at high speeds can contribute to lost steps at higher speeds, so you\u2019ll want to test at high speeds, and then reduce the parameter to stay away from trouble. Adjusting Max Accelerations \u00b6 You can change the accelerations similarly to the speeds, just use M204 instead. Again, the V1Engineering accelerations should be a good start for almost everyone. If you have a lot of steps/mm, the acceleration doesn\u2019t need to be changed. The acceleration is more based on the amount of mass you are moving and rigidity of the machine. You will want to test your accelerations by sending a large move command at max speed. For example, an X move of 100mm at 1000mm/s. The Acceleration and speeds will be maxed out, and if you skip any steps, then you need to go way lower. Some people prefer a much smaller acceleration, because it makes the machine seem more gentle or smart. Configuring Separate Travel Speeds \u00b6 By default, Marlin treats G00 commands as though they were just G01 commands. But many of the CNC friendly G-Code Senders and CAM use G00 to just move the machine as fast as possible. Because of this default treatment in Marlin, the last feedrate requested in a G01 command will be used in a G00 command. If you don\u2019t want that behavior, and you want G00 to just move as fast as possible, you can use this option in the Configuration_adv.h: // Enable and set a (default) feedrate for all G0 moves //#define G0_FEEDRATE 3000 // (mm/m) #ifdef G0_FEEDRATE //#define VARIABLE_G0_FEEDRATE // The G0 feedrate is set by F in G0 motion mode #endif If you define G0_FEEDRATE , then that will always get used for G0 commands (and still be subject to the max speeds and accelerations). If you define that and VARIABLE_G0_FEEDRATE , then any feedrate defined on a G0 command will stick and any future G0 commands will use that speed (unless they define their own). One useful configuration might be to set your max speeds and accelerations to something that will never skip (in air) and then set the G0_FEEDRATE to something high. All travel moves will be as fast as possible after that.","title":"Motion"},{"location":"learn/motion/#motion-101","text":"","title":"Motion 101"},{"location":"learn/motion/#introduction","text":"Try to explain a CNC machine to a 5 year old, and you\u2019ll probably say something like, \u201cIt moves a tool around to cut out shapes\u201d.

If you don\u2019t define one, it will just use the previous one.","title":"Motion Background"},{"location":"learn/motion/#g-code-feedrate","text":"","title":"G-Code Feedrate"},{"location":"learn/motion/#example-g-code","text":"Look at these commands (for more detail, look at the g-code tutorial ): G00 X0.00 Y0.00 Z0.00 G00 X10.00 G01 Z-0.1 F300.00 G01 X100.00 F600 G01 Y100.00 At first, it looks fine. But there is a problem. The first two commands don\u2019t have a feedrate defined. So whatever speed the last command was at, is what is going to be used. At the 3 rd line, we finally set a feedrate. On the 4 th , it is changed to something new, and on the last line, there is no feedrate, so the 600 is used again.","title":"Example G-Code"},{"location":"learn/motion/#details","text":"The feedrates in gcode describe the speed to travel along the line. So, for example, if you were at 0,0 and you were travelling to 100mm,100mm, and the feedrate was set to 100mm/s, it would travel at a speed of 100mm/s, but have 140mm to travel, so it would take about 1.4s to get there. If you sent the same command with a feedrate of 140mm/s, then it would take 1 second to finish that move. The limits on the speeds in Marlin are axis based. So if you set the max speed rate in X to 50mm/s and the max feedrate in Y to 50mm/s, Marlin will slow down this move to not exceed that speed on either axis. So the speed would end up being 70mm/s, and finish in about 2 seconds. So I use these terms in this document: Feedrate The maximum speed along the straight line in gcode. Max Speed The maximum speed along a single axis. Note In the past, some versions of Marlin have not protected against speeds higher than their max. All indications are the current Marlin (V1Engineering 418+) are responding well to adjustments in the max feedrate. Those total timing numbers aren\u2019t completely right. Because Marlin also doesn\u2019t go from a full stop to top speed instantly. It will use the acceleration values to decide how quickly to ramp up the speed to it\u2019s top speed. So this move that takes 2s and maxes out at 50mm/s in each direction will actually take a bit longer, because it will start out slower, and work its way up to 50mm/s. Then at the end, it will slow down before the end of the 100mm, and stop smoothly. You can really see the effect if you drop your accelerations very slow. Movements are more smooth, but they sometimes take a lot longer. The accelerations are also applied on a per axis basis, so on a high speed move, the X axis will be accelerating at it\u2019s max acceleration and the Y will be accelerating at it\u2019s max acceleration. The total acceleration on a compound move will be higher along the line. Jerk, or Junction Deviation are used because even on the corner of a square, you don\u2019t want to stop completely. That will just slow things down more than necessary. These other parameters consider how fast to take a turn.","title":"Details"},{"location":"learn/motion/#adjusting-max-speed","text":"You can easily change the max speeds and accelerations because they are stored in the EEPROM, and they are read in every time you start (or boot) Marlin. You can change these at any time, but remember to save your changes by writing out to the EEPROM. M203 X30 Y30 Z10 This will set the X and Y speeds to 30mm/s (notice this is in mm/s, whereas feedrates are in mm/min) and the Z to 10mm/s. M500 This will save all the value to the EEPROM. Marlin Reference Generally, the defaults in the V1Engineering firmware are conservative enough for these machines. If you want to go faster and know the consequences, then by all means, change them. If you installed a high steps/mm Z and you need to slow down your Z, then this is a good way to do it. Here is the general rule of thumb for speeds. You shouldn\u2019t allow the machine to go so fast that it skips steps when not cutting material. Friction in the machine, or loss of torque at high speeds can contribute to lost steps at higher speeds, so you\u2019ll want to test at high speeds, and then reduce the parameter to stay away from trouble.","title":"Adjusting Max Speed"},{"location":"learn/motion/#adjusting-max-accelerations","text":"You can change the accelerations similarly to the speeds, just use M204 instead. Again, the V1Engineering accelerations should be a good start for almost everyone. If you have a lot of steps/mm, the acceleration doesn\u2019t need to be changed. The acceleration is more based on the amount of mass you are moving and rigidity of the machine. You will want to test your accelerations by sending a large move command at max speed. For example, an X move of 100mm at 1000mm/s. The Acceleration and speeds will be maxed out, and if you skip any steps, then you need to go way lower. Some people prefer a much smaller acceleration, because it makes the machine seem more gentle or smart.","title":"Adjusting Max Accelerations"},{"location":"learn/motion/#configuring-separate-travel-speeds","text":"By default, Marlin treats G00 commands as though they were just G01 commands. But many of the CNC friendly G-Code Senders and CAM use G00 to just move the machine as fast as possible. Because of this default treatment in Marlin, the last feedrate requested in a G01 command will be used in a G00 command. If you don\u2019t want that behavior, and you want G00 to just move as fast as possible, you can use this option in the Configuration_adv.h: // Enable and set a (default) feedrate for all G0 moves //#define G0_FEEDRATE 3000 // (mm/m) #ifdef G0_FEEDRATE //#define VARIABLE_G0_FEEDRATE // The G0 feedrate is set by F in G0 motion mode #endif If you define G0_FEEDRATE , then that will always get used for G0 commands (and still be subject to the max speeds and accelerations). If you define that and VARIABLE_G0_FEEDRATE , then any feedrate defined on a G0 command will stick and any future G0 commands will use that speed (unless they define their own). One useful configuration might be to set your max speeds and accelerations to something that will never skip (in air) and then set the G0_FEEDRATE to something high. All travel moves will be as fast as possible after that.","title":"Configuring Separate Travel Speeds"},{"location":"learn/platformio/","text":"PlatformIO \u00b6 PlatformIO is another way to prepare firmware (amongst other things) to use on your control board after making any changes or updates.

However, when broken down into manageable pieces it\u2019s easy to digest. Here, we will describe the different steps in the CNC milling workflow process along with their associated software components/tools. The goal is to provide you a better understanding of some of the steps and terminology, which in turn gives you the background to better seek help and explore possibilities. Overview \u00b6 This is the 1000ft (304m) overview (we will explore each in more detail within the sections that follow). There are 4 components to the workflow and associated software as follows: Step Software 1 Design CAD (Computer Assisted Design) or Vector Graphics Editor 2 Toolpath Generation CAM (Computer Assisted Machining) 3 G-Code Sending Sender 4 Milling Controller Design The first step is to make or get a design. If you are making one, then you will probably use a CAD program (for functional parts, like a gear) or a Vector Graphics Editor (for art, like a sign). The output of this step is typically either a 2D file (like a .DXF or .SVG) or sometimes (but not often) a 3D file (like a .STL). Toolpath Generation This is the step where you take your design, and describe which lines to engrave, which areas to cut out, and which parts to leave. It defines what \u201cpaths\u201d your \u201ctool\u201d is going to take. CAM also is where you will define what kinds of milling bits you have, and how fast and deep you want to move them through the material. The output of this step is g-code (in a .gcode or .nc file). G-code is the \u201clanguage\u201d of the instructions for your CNC. G-code Sender The g-code is just a list of instructions that define where the tool should go. The software used to \u201cplay\u201d these instructions is the g-code sender and communicates with the controller. There are a number of options for this software. Most people have a personal preference along with it being well matched with your controller. Controller The controller is responsible for taking g-code instructions and managing the precise movements of the motors. There are other jobs, but they are all related to this one function. There is firmware (software on a chip) that facilitates this. In the CNC world there are many \u201cflavors\u201d of this firmware. In our CNC machines, the most common flavors are Marlin and Grbl. Design \u00b6 There are many options for CAD and Vector Graphics Editors. Either can take thousands of hours to master. So we can\u2019t go into too much detail here. Luckily, you don\u2019t have to be a master to get your hands dirty. There are two common methods of creating designs for a CNC machine: Note Sometimes, you can find a design that is already a .DXF or a .SVG. If so, great! You can easily skip the Design step. In fact, for signs, there are many SVG\u2019s on Etsy that are inexpensive to purchase. Functional Parts Design \u00b6 If you are making functional parts, then you want a CAD tool. The output you want is usually .DXF. Imagine you want to make a toolbox, you would draw out each side of the toolbox and export a .DXF for each face of the box. You care a lot about the size of each side, because it all has to fit together when you are done. These programs can all create DXF files and they all have a lot of information on their use (This is not an exhaustive list, but if you want to add something else, feel free to edit this document . Autodesk Fusion 360 Onshape.com SketchUp OpenSCAD LibreCAD TinkerCAD Art Design \u00b6 If you want to carve out art, signs, lettering, or logos then you\u2019ll want to use .SVG files. These parts have important dimensions and measurements, but they are usually drawn in programs specializing in art. The most common programs are Inkscape and Adobe Illustrator. In these programs, you can very precisely adjust the shape to get an aesthetically pleasing design, or import another design and adjust it. Note If you have a piece of art in a .jpg, .png, or .bmp format, you can\u2019t directly use that. To make it usable, you can use Inkscape. Try searching for inkscape trace bitmap tutorial Toolpath Generation/CAM \u00b6 Note If you are familiar with 3D printing, this is similar to the slicer step (but not as automated). Now that you have a design, you basically have just a bunch of shapes or objects. You still haven\u2019t said which shapes need to be cut out, which shapes need to be engraved or drilled, and which shapes need to be completely removed. In CAM, you will select the shapes and choose which operations you want to perform. For example, if you are cutting out letters, you will need to use CAM to cut out each letter. You will also need to tell it how far to cut. It doesn\u2019t know anything about the material, so if you\u2019re cutting through 10mm ply or 5mm ply, you need to tell it so it doesn\u2019t over cut (too much). You also haven\u2019t told the machine how fast or deep to cut. There are many different settings related to the cutting (for example, how fast to \u201cplunge\u201d or dive into the material, how fast to move through the material, what kind of pattern to use when cutting out a pocket). Each material, each machine, and each bit will require a different set of parameters for how fast to move material, how many passes to take, and how deep you can go on each pass. There is a real art to making good CAM. Knowing your machine and making lots of test cuts can make a lot of difference in total time spent, and output quality. After CAM understands everything you want it to do, it will make a g-code file. The g-code file is a list of instructions for the Controller. It is important that the instructions are compatible with the controller you have. If you bought a controller from V1Engineering\u2019s shop, then it is running Marlin, and the CAM software needs to be configured to output g-code files compatible with the Marlin controller. There is a lot more detailed information in the Milling Basics , Estlcam Basics , and Estlcam 2.5D . Warning Fusion 360 does have CAM built in, and there is a Post processor available for it. It works great, but Fusion 360 CAM can be confusing, and it is highly recommended to start with Estlcam first. Even if you decide to later use the Fusion 360 CAM, the skills learned with Estlcam will be easier to learn, and will directly apply to any CAM software. G-code Sender \u00b6 The term \u201cG-code Sender\u201d isn\u2019t a very technical term, because there are so many ways to \u201cplay back\u201d a g-code file. A g-code file is just a list of instructions, with one instruction on each line. These need to be played back, one after another, so that the controller knows what to do. In addition to playback of g-code files, this software also does some basic setup. It needs to be able to send \u201cjog\u201d commands, which just move the machine around in one direction at a time. And it also needs to be able to set the \u201czero\u201d location to set up the cut. In dual endstop machines, it should also be able to command the homing sequence (Most CNC machines don\u2019t need endstops like 3D printers because the start location is on the workpiece, not the machine). The simplest method to do this is with Repetier-Host . The other simple method is to also install an LCD screen on the controller, which will take an SD card. You can put the file on the SD card, and set the whole thing up on the LCD, and play the file without bringing a computer into the shop. There are many other advanced ways to send gcode. You can hook up a raspberry pi, and use the v1pi image . You can use CNC.js standalone on your computer, or use pronterface. Controller/Firmware \u00b6 The final step is to actually do the milling/cutting. Obviously this is done by the tool at the end of the gantry, but it is facilitated by the controller. The controller takes movement commands, and drives the motors. If you bought the controller from the V1Engineering shop, then it is running Marlin. Marlin is designed for 3D printing (and so are a lot of tools we use). Don\u2019t be surprised if you see something labeled \u201cprint\u201d when you think it should be \u201ccut\u201d. The V1Engineering Shop sells the controllers flashed and ready to use. If you want to update them, or you need to change the software for some reason, there are preconfigured versions of Marlin for some boards. There are a lot more detailed instructions in the Marlin firmware section of the docs.\u2019 Warning You will see \u201cArduino\u201d used a lot in discussions around the V1Engineering machines. It is the software used to flash the controller. It is not involved with running the machine. Summary \u00b6 That really is it. If you see someone talking about software or firmware in the forums, it is probably something that fits into one of these categories. Don\u2019t get intimidated, and do ask questions. We were all beginners at some point (many of us, not that long ago).","title":"Software Workflow"},{"location":"learn/software_overview/#software-workflow","text":"Starting out in the CNC world can be very intimidating, even if you already know about 3D printing (which is a CNC machine, technically).

If you bought a controller from V1Engineering\u2019s shop, then it is running Marlin, and the CAM software needs to be configured to output g-code files compatible with the Marlin controller. There is a lot more detailed information in the Milling Basics , Estlcam Basics , and Estlcam 2.5D . Warning Fusion 360 does have CAM built in, and there is a Post processor available for it. It works great, but Fusion 360 CAM can be confusing, and it is highly recommended to start with Estlcam first. Even if you decide to later use the Fusion 360 CAM, the skills learned with Estlcam will be easier to learn, and will directly apply to any CAM software.","title":"Toolpath Generation/CAM"},{"location":"learn/software_overview/#g-code-sender","text":"The term \u201cG-code Sender\u201d isn\u2019t a very technical term, because there are so many ways to \u201cplay back\u201d a g-code file. A g-code file is just a list of instructions, with one instruction on each line. These need to be played back, one after another, so that the controller knows what to do. In addition to playback of g-code files, this software also does some basic setup. It needs to be able to send \u201cjog\u201d commands, which just move the machine around in one direction at a time. And it also needs to be able to set the \u201czero\u201d location to set up the cut. In dual endstop machines, it should also be able to command the homing sequence (Most CNC machines don\u2019t need endstops like 3D printers because the start location is on the workpiece, not the machine). The simplest method to do this is with Repetier-Host . The other simple method is to also install an LCD screen on the controller, which will take an SD card. You can put the file on the SD card, and set the whole thing up on the LCD, and play the file without bringing a computer into the shop. There are many other advanced ways to send gcode. You can hook up a raspberry pi, and use the v1pi image . You can use CNC.js standalone on your computer, or use pronterface.","title":"G-code Sender"},{"location":"learn/software_overview/#controllerfirmware","text":"The final step is to actually do the milling/cutting. Obviously this is done by the tool at the end of the gantry, but it is facilitated by the controller. The controller takes movement commands, and drives the motors. If you bought the controller from the V1Engineering shop, then it is running Marlin. Marlin is designed for 3D printing (and so are a lot of tools we use). Don\u2019t be surprised if you see something labeled \u201cprint\u201d when you think it should be \u201ccut\u201d. The V1Engineering Shop sells the controllers flashed and ready to use. If you want to update them, or you need to change the software for some reason, there are preconfigured versions of Marlin for some boards. There are a lot more detailed instructions in the Marlin firmware section of the docs.\u2019 Warning You will see \u201cArduino\u201d used a lot in discussions around the V1Engineering machines.

Of course you can go smaller. If the MPCNC is not big enough for you this picks up where that left off. Thingiverse Printed parts files: 25.4mm version Thingiverse Link 25mm version Thingiverse Link Hardware list Link TODO Should we be converting this parts list too? This CNC router can handle any length (within reason), the Y direction is only bound by your table length. Width (X direction on rails) should always be the shorter axis and is recommended to keep the work area no larger than 4\u2032 on this axis. The Z direction (height) is best kept to a 3-4\u2033 maximum for wood, with that being said, you can make the usable z length as much as you want you will be working from the bottom up, so go to town. Calculator for table, rail, and belt lengths. Version 1 Version one instructions are here Assembly \u00b6 All quantities shown in the drawings are for each assembly, not total quantities. Center Assembly \u00b6 The VacDuct, sits inside the router clamp body to separate the router exhaust and the vacuum intake. When setting the tension for the X Mounts after attaching them to the plate set the tension for each mount individually. An easy way is to use the Z rail and run it through each one, very light tension, you might not even need to add any, the mounts are interference fit. Z Assemblies \u00b6 When fully assembled the XZ main\u2019s should sit completely flat on the YZ rollers. If not check these three points. Double check that the Z rails are parallel, same distance apart at the bottom as they are on the top. If you loosen the corner brackets up too much and the XZ mains still won\u2019t sit flat the larger bolts are not tensioned properly / evenly (probably way way too much). Make sure all four notches are above the end of the Z rails. The XZ & XZ_side should be installed with an equal gap on all four screws. There should be a gap of a few millimeters equally on each side of the corners to the XZ Main. These parts can alter the Z rail angles so care is needed. They do not need to be extremely tight, a little pressure goes a long way. This is how these couplers should be used. The coupler should not be compressed, if anything a little stretch to make sure the lead screw is in contact with the stepper shaft. This prevents bouncing. The lead screw should be only inserted as far as the coupler bottom collar. This lets the stepper shaft and lead screw to move for any minor misalignment. Seat the grub screws on the shaft trying to get the straightest connection possible. If you hit an edge it will get wonky just give it a little turn and try again. On the stepper shaft tighten the flat screw first then the one that hits the round surface. Do not forget to lube the Z lead screws. There is a small notch / ridge to prevent the Z rails from coming out of the top on all 4 parts. If your rails are crooked this is where to check. Sides \u00b6 It is best not to tighten the M3 screws all the way on the T8 nuts. This allows for a touch of misalignment and smoother Z action. Don\u2019t worry their only job it to stop rotation, gravity does the rest. Belts \u00b6 Belt Insert \u00b6 Why? The cable_tie_insert was made to eliminate the flex and bounce of the cable tie and belt connection. This will help keep a reasonable arc in the cable tie at the belt end provided you use the clasp end as shown and the belt flat. This should eliminate cable tie/belt flex on a properly tensioned belt and the tension should stay true longer. The other end of the cable tie connection is rounded internally on all printed parts with a similar arc. Using a few segments of the belt itself when securing the end ensures a better connection on the belts teeth. 3-4 teeth facing teeth up will make for a more round surface of the cable tie that secures the folded belt. This will prevent a wide belt from cupping and slipping teeth. Belt Ends \u00b6 Table \u00b6 Use the dimensions from the calculator, make it as flat and square as you can. The edges guide the machine so those are important. I used some 2\u2033x3\u2033 and \u00bd\u2033 particle board on top. The X direction is more important to get flat than the Y direction, so build accordingly. Usually this means solid supports in The X direction. If you can picture it the machine and material can follow a subtle curve down the length much more so than the width. Note Ideal table thickness is 4\u2033 or less. Firmware \u00b6 The standard MPCNC firmware will work with any board on the LowRider2. Dual endstop firmware is not really needed since all three axis have hard stops you can use for alignment. Firmware page. For the creative of you, you could use the dual end stop firmware for Y alignment or even Z (homing min or max). Hose Channel \u00b6 I use 1.5\u2033-2\u2033 aluminum angle with a few Velcro straps to keep the hose and cords contained. Bigger or smaller works depending on the hose size you use. Getting Started \u00b6 Using the machine. \u00b6 1) Square it up. After mounting your work piece (making sure the mounting hardware is not going to interfere) I check to make sure the sides (Assemblies with the wheels on them) are the same distance from the nearest end. You can do this by making sure the wheels are hitting the stop blocks/belt mounts. 2) Double check. You only need to do this the first few times until you understand the machine. Use the LCD to control the machine. Lift the gantry high enough as to not drag the bit across your material. Drive the machine the entire length of what you will be cutting. This is to make sure the machine does not hit the table and you are parallel with it. Another way to do this is include an outline in your design and use it as your fist tool path above your material. This is to make sure nothing binds or hits. 3) Set your starting position. Use the lcd to position the bit at your zero position in all three axis. 4) Beginning gcode. If you use the Fusion 360 post processor this is done for you but make sure your beginning gcode resets all your axis to 0,0,0 , you can use this command, G92 X0 Y0 Z0 . 5) Ending gcode. What should happen is your job ends above your last position, meaning your bit should not drag across the surface if you move it. With the bit above the last position, telling the machine to go back to the starting position will return the machine to where you started it and then making sure the steppers do not turn off is a good idea as the LowRider will drop under it\u2019s own weight. The last few lines of your gcode should look like this. G1 Z7 F400 (this is my clearance plane and is already in my gcode) G1 X0 Y0 F2100 (I add this to have the machine drive its self back to the start) At this point you can use the lcd to move the machine clear of your material and lower it, then power off. Or, if you leave a little room you can drive past your starting point and lower automatically.

This is the MP3DP -V2- Milled/Printed 3D Printer Version 2 . This is a fun project to use your new CNC mill for. The V2 has tightened up some of the designs from my first version, every single part is different. Nothing too major. Better belt placement, better frame geometry, more robust parts, better extruder mount, easier to set home stops, slightly larger build volume, ability to use thicker material for the frame, optional bottom plate for rigidity, better smooth rod handling. This page \u00b6 If you just want to open a box and have a ready 3D printer there are a few solid options out there. The MP3DP V2 is a printer for those of you that want to build one, get your hands dirty, and learn a thing or two! Currently this is just a guide, not a full set of instructions. If anything is unclear let us know and we can add a picture or two. Hopefully nothing is to tricky here. Github Questions comment \u2013 HERE . Version 1 Version one instructions are here Flat Parts \u00b6 The frame components were designed for \u215c\u2033 material this time, the bed support is still good for \u00bc\u2033 (the lighter the better for the bed). All the parts can safely go above a little thicker than \u00bd\u2033 and as thin as you want for those of you with access to high tech materials. Material thickness will determine some screw lengths as outlined below. I have included a \u201cY Speed Plate\u201d for the ultimate bed support. I use insulation under my bed so I also included a full \u201cY Plate\u201d, also needed for you savages that use 4 corner heated bed mounting. Make sure only to cut the one you need as you do not need both. All inside corners were designed with \u215b\u2033 diameter or smaller end mills.

Bottom Plate \u00b6 Completely optional This is the HeffePlate V2, Jeffeb3 made one for the first version. This is just the updated one. If you use it counter sink the screws so it sits flat and it should allow for thinner frame material to be used as well. Over all it just keeps things more square and and rigid.

Pass through the block and tension the other parts. Make sure the ends clear and do not hit the pulley or idler. Better alignment? GT2 Idlers \u00b6 I took a while to release these parts because my idlers kept seizing up. I have two suggestions, first lube them well, I am using the super lube from the shop, no issues since. Second belt tension does not have to be super human here. Start loose and only tighten the belts if you notice issues. Too tight=excessive ringing and premature idler damage, Too loose=soft rounded corners and poor wall consistancy. X Axis \u00b6 Easy adjust, more consistent belt tension. Use the screws to set the smooth rods into place, or use super glue like before. They should be adjusted top an bottom to, 301mm. you can measure this top and bottom to ensure the ends are parallel. Wires \u00b6 If you need a good first printing project how about a box to hide those wires, Gnarly Mini-Rambo Case , or a case for the LCD ? Extruders \u00b6 I have designed this with both the Titan Aero , and the MK8 in mind they both work great choice is yours. The mounting plate is pretty straight forward the holes are easy enough to utilize for anything you might need if you don\u2019t like either of those. The holes are 64mm apart. Printed Parts \u00b6 Infill on the parts is not a big deal I use 15%-20%, but make sure to use 2-3 perimeter walls to keep the through hole support.

Hardware \u00b6 Here is a simplified hardware list, a few parts are made for shorter hardware but this is as simple as it gets. You can also go longer on most all of these. M3.5mm is almost a direct fit for the #6-32 screws, some seem not to want to order these online if they can\u2019t find them locally so an M4 will probably work. I really suggest just ordering a box of M3.5\u2019s for simplicity. Qty Name Comment 3 #6-32 x 1.5\u2033 Hex heads. These are for the XYZ endstop adjustments. 60 #6-32 x ??(1\u2033) Frame screw length depends on frame material thickness, round up in length. See Below. 55 #6-32 Nylocs 20 M3 x 10mm Stepper and T8 nut screws 5 M3 x 22mm Bed adjustment and Idler screws 4 M3 Nylocs 3 Control Board screws mount screws,standoffs dependent on your board. e.g. (M3x22mm with 10mm rubber standoffs) 3 Power supply screws mount screws,standoffs dependent on your power supply. e.g.(M5 x 20mm 7mm rubber standoffs) The control board and power supply screws will depend on your hardware, frame thickness and preferred stand off distance, easy thing to do is cut rubber hose as the standoffs. Screw length \u00b6 This is the hard part. A \u00be\u2033 screw is a thread or two away from fitting a \u215c\u2033 frame board, counter sinking would make them fit. I chose to use 1\u2033 instead. you need .423\u2033 (that is the printed part and nut thickness) plus the thickness of your frame / bed material, minimum. Longer should not be an issue. Bed bearings \u00b6 Trying out a new style here, one side is shorter to allow for clamping if necessary. I found it usually is not, If you over tighten it you can actually crush the bearings and damage them. Default to super loose or no clamp screw/nut at all. Just a screw on the flush side should be enough. EndStops \u00b6 The endstops should be wired Normally Closed, NC, for safety. Initial leveling \u00b6 Rough When setting up your printer first level your X axis. Measure from the top of the motor mounts to the bottom of the vertical bearing blocks. The next thing is to level the bed. This is done by setting the 2 screws on the right side (front and back) to the nozzle height, then set the single screw on the left of the bed. Home Set each of the three endstop trigger screws such that the nozzle comes to rest just touching the print surface in the nearest left corner. Final and tune up Heat up the system, make sure the X axis is still level with the motor mounts, make sure the bed is still level with the nozzle. Adjust Z home trigger screw to get the correct first layer. Firmware \u00b6 The beta Marlin 2.0 version is on the github page , or the old MP3DP firmware works (found below as a backup). There are nots on the github version there are two settings that need to be changed for the MK8 or the Titan Aero, the thermistor value 11 for the MK8 or 5 for the Aero, and 100 steps for the E on the MK8. Slicer and MK8 \u00b6 If you need some initial settings to get started there are slicer settings at the end of this page , and a breakdown of an MK8 assembly.","title":"Main"},{"location":"mp3dp/#mp3dp-v2-","text":"This is my take on a Prusa I3, with a CNC mill friendly frame.

You will need to drill 4 holes for M5 screws. It is best to oversize the holes (up to about 8mm is fine) to allow for some adjustment and non-perfect drilling. Mark the rails according to the previous diagram. A center punch, center drill, or even filing a small flat spot helps with drilling accuracy. Tip You can draw a straight line on one rail using the other as a guide and/or a square block roughly half as high as the rail. Deburring the edges of the holes ensures good tool mount alignment. Leadscrew \u00b6 This step requires a stepper, 5mm to 8mm coupler, and your leadscrew. Note The cut calculator give you a minimum screw length. The maximum screw length is the end of the Z rails when your axis is fully assembled. Loctite is a good idea for the small grub screws. Tighten the grub screw on the flat spot of the stepper shaft first. This is how these couplers should be used. The coupler should not be compressed; if anything, a little stretch to make sure the lead screw is in contact with the stepper shaft - this prevents bouncing. The lead screw should only be inserted as far as the coupler bottom collar. This lets the stepper shaft and leadscrew move for any minor misalignment. Seat the grub screws on the shaft trying to get the straightest connection possible. If you hit an edge of a thread it will get wonky; just give it a little turn and try again. On the stepper shaft, tighten the flat screw first then the one that hits the round surface. Stepper \u00b6 This step uses 4 M3x10mm screws, the printed Z Motor part, and the previous leadscrew assembly. Snug down all 4 screws. These stepper screws are easy to cross thread, take it slow and do not force anything. Thrust Block \u00b6 All you need is a bearing and the printed Z Coupler part for this step. Seat the bearing - the top should be flush with the part. Z Axis \u00b6 You will need all of the previous assemblies from this step. Pay attention to the direction the Z Coupler part is facing. Face the bearing towards the coupler. They will end up touching. Slide both rails in. The holes you drilled angle in and are on the same end. Info The lower Z Coupler part stays just above the middle holes to help with alignment. Don\u2019t push it all together yet. The stepper assembly should be flush with the top of the Z rails. Note The leadscrew can be a tight fit through the bearing. If this is the case you can sand the top 30mm or so of the leadscrew and put the bearing on before the coupler. Nut Traps \u00b6 You will need the printed Nut Trap parts, and four M5 nuts. Pay attention to the direction the nylocks are facing. Seat the nuts in fully. A drop of glue is a good idea here. These are blind nuts and that prevents them from getting pushed out. Slide the Nut Traps into the rails. Pointy end first. The bottoms of the Nut Traps should be flush with the bottoms of the Z rails and the holes aligned. Tool Mount \u00b6 For this step you will need your tool mount of choice, 2-4 M5 screws depending on the mount, and both Upper and Lower printed Tool Plates. This is showing the Dewalt 660 mount. Using the embossed part letter as your guide position the plates. For this mount it is easy to start the screws and then loosely fit both tool mount pieces and get the screw well into the nuts. Once all four screws are started you can tighten them all a little at a time to keep the rails aligned. Snug these up all the way. You can now slide the Z Coupler part up to the coupler. The bearing should make contact with the coupler, it prevents the coupler stretching. Snug up the stepper assembly to the Z rails. Warning These are clamping parts so there will be a gap even when the part is tight. Very little force is needed here; 4 screws have a lot of holding power and they are only holding a few pounds. Push the bearing plate up to the coupler and make sure they are touching. The plates should be parallel and have equal spacing on both sides. Snug up the plate. Warning You can get the plate too tight and make the leadscrew hard to rotate. Once you have finished this step, make sure the coupler moves easily with your fingers. Z Core \u00b6 For this step you will need 4 nuts and bolts, and all four Core Z Clamp printed parts. The Core Z Clamps have an angled edge that should match the angled edge on the Core itself. Warning These bolts need to be extremely loose, only turn to just get the nylocks engaged. Insert the Z axis and get the leadscrew started to hold it in place. Very carefully start to tighten each clamp. You want each bearing to be in contact with the rail but you should just be able to rotate the bearing with your fingers. 1/16 th of a turn here can be drastic. Take your time. You want each bearing to be in equal tension. This flexes the Core properly and keeps the Z axis perpendicular to the work surface. Over tightening is detrimental. Again, loose is better than tight. Move the axis up and down and check for free movement through the entire range. Tip You can give the Clamps a little tap to make sure they are seated correctly once they have some tension on them. Recheck the tension in the bearings. Note If your leadscrew starts to bind at the very bottom this is when you can move the brass nut screws around a bit to make sure this has smooth easy movements. Lubricate the Leadscrew \u00b6 The leadscrew needs lubrication .

Pay attention to the direction the nylocks are facing. Seat the nuts in fully. A drop of glue is a good idea here. These are blind nuts and that prevents them from getting pushed out. Slide the Nut Traps into the rails. Pointy end first. The bottoms of the Nut Traps should be flush with the bottoms of the Z rails and the holes aligned.","title":"Nut Traps"},{"location":"mpcnc/PZPage/#tool-mount","text":"For this step you will need your tool mount of choice, 2-4 M5 screws depending on the mount, and both Upper and Lower printed Tool Plates. This is showing the Dewalt 660 mount. Using the embossed part letter as your guide position the plates. For this mount it is easy to start the screws and then loosely fit both tool mount pieces and get the screw well into the nuts. Once all four screws are started you can tighten them all a little at a time to keep the rails aligned. Snug these up all the way. You can now slide the Z Coupler part up to the coupler. The bearing should make contact with the coupler, it prevents the coupler stretching. Snug up the stepper assembly to the Z rails. Warning These are clamping parts so there will be a gap even when the part is tight. Very little force is needed here; 4 screws have a lot of holding power and they are only holding a few pounds. Push the bearing plate up to the coupler and make sure they are touching. The plates should be parallel and have equal spacing on both sides. Snug up the plate. Warning You can get the plate too tight and make the leadscrew hard to rotate. Once you have finished this step, make sure the coupler moves easily with your fingers.","title":"Tool Mount"},{"location":"mpcnc/PZPage/#z-core","text":"For this step you will need 4 nuts and bolts, and all four Core Z Clamp printed parts. The Core Z Clamps have an angled edge that should match the angled edge on the Core itself. Warning These bolts need to be extremely loose, only turn to just get the nylocks engaged. Insert the Z axis and get the leadscrew started to hold it in place. Very carefully start to tighten each clamp. You want each bearing to be in contact with the rail but you should just be able to rotate the bearing with your fingers. 1/16 th of a turn here can be drastic. Take your time. You want each bearing to be in equal tension. This flexes the Core properly and keeps the Z axis perpendicular to the work surface. Over tightening is detrimental. Again, loose is better than tight. Move the axis up and down and check for free movement through the entire range. Tip You can give the Clamps a little tap to make sure they are seated correctly once they have some tension on them. Recheck the tension in the bearings. Note If your leadscrew starts to bind at the very bottom this is when you can move the brass nut screws around a bit to make sure this has smooth easy movements.","title":"Z Core"},{"location":"mpcnc/PZPage/#lubricate-the-leadscrew","text":"The leadscrew needs lubrication .

Legs \u00b6 The leg lengths come from the cut calculator . Do whatever it takes to get the legs as equal in length as possible. This will really help in leveling and keeping it level. In this picture the one on the left is too short so it could either be shimmed during assembly or sand/grind the others. A little extra time here pays off for the life of the machine. Tip Sand, grind, or file the inside and outside edges of all the cuts on the rails and legs. This prevents cut wires and eases assembly. Tools \u00b6 8mm Socket or nut driver Phillips #2 Screw driver Legs and Feet \u00b6 You will need the legs, printed feet, M5x30 screws and locknuts. Tip It is best to pre-thread all the locknuts before assembly. This will loosen them and prevent mangling of the printed parts. Insert the leg and make sure it is seated all the way to the table. The feet have a small side for the head of the screw and a larger opening for the nut and socket. Snug this screw. Snug means just a \u00bc turn past the nut making contact. This is does not need to be super tight. There is a 2+mm gap here, do not try to close the gap . Base Layout \u00b6 Use whatever screws are appropriate for your table, these are not included in the V1 Kits. Layout the foot assemblies on your table according to the dimensions from the cut calculator . Notice all the clamping screws are oriented towards the center of the build area. Screw down the two assemblies along the front edge of the table. These will be your fixed references. Measure as carefully and accurately as you can across the leg tops. Your machine can only be as accurate as you build it. Compare this measurement to the next one. This next diagonal should match the previous one. Squaring this way can be extremely accurate because any error in the leg locations is multiplied in this measurement. Adjust both rear legs until you are satisfied with the precision. Screw in one foot at a time, minor adjustments are possible. Triple check the diagonals - they need to be as close as you can get them. Tip Marking and pre-drilling the foot hold downs in the center of the screw slots makes it much easier to get a square base and leaves a tiny bit of room for adjustment. Leg Locks \u00b6 You will need the printed Corner Leg Locks and M5 locknuts. It is best to pre-thread all the locknuts before assembly. This will loosen them and prevent mangling of the printed parts. Push the nut into the Corner Leg Lock and fully seat it. If it does not stay on it\u2019s own you can use a drop of glue. If the nut does not stay on it\u2019s own, you can attach the Corner Bottom very loosely with its bolt. Fully seat the Corner Leg Locks onto the legs. Orient to match the Feet below. Do not lock/clamp them. Corner Bottoms \u00b6 You will need the printed Corner Bottoms and Corner Bottom Mirrored and M5x30 screws. Warning If you are not using the V1 Kit please make sure your screw heads are low profile enough not to interfere with the Lower Rail. The Corner Bottoms go on the Leg Locks as shown. Pay attention to how the belt slider slots are oriented. They point towards each other on the outside of the build area. This picture is taken with the 0,0 (home) corner in the bottom nearest left. The corners should be as shown. Get the screws started to hold the Leg Locks and Corner Bottoms together. Leave them loose, just tight enough to make the screw head clear the rail. Temporarily adding the Y rails will align the corners. Lock The Legs \u00b6 You will need four sets of the M5 screws and locknuts. It is best to pre-thread all the locknuts before assembly. This will loosen them and prevent mangling of the printed parts. Snug up all four Leg Locks. Snug is just that, \u00bc turn past the screw and nut seating into the part. Just tight enough to make the corner have some resistance if you try to take it off the leg. All clamping parts have a gap. Do not clamp it hard enough to close the gap ! Now remove the rails and snug up the screw in the bottom of the corner pieces. Tip This screw is tightened after the Leg Locks so the Corner Bottom will correctly and fully seat on the angled joint between the two parts. If you tighten the bottom first you might have a hard time locking the leg into place or the Corner Bottom could come loose. Leveling \u00b6 Put the Y rails back in place. Use whatever means you have at your disposal to assure all four corners are at the same level. If you were careful with your leg lengths this should be level already. Loosening the screws and giving the corners a light tap can seat them a tiny bit farther if needed. Final Check. \u00b6 Best practice is to check your work at every step. Measure the diagonal measurement to the best of your abilities. This diagonal should match. You should aim for no more than 1mm deviation.

You can line them up and give them a tap with the ratchet handle and they should pop into place. This is intentional to add rigidity. Hint If you pop the bearings in too far or need to get them out, the rear has a hole for an Allen key to push them back out. Paying attention to the direction of the bolt heads, insert the bolts and nuts. Snug these bolts up, just 1/16 th of a turn past seated (touching the plastic on both sides). Caution Ratchets are dangerous here. We only need 7in/lbs or so. It is next to nothing. Loose is better than too tight. That is true for all of these steps. Inner Z Bearings \u00b6 4 more bolts, nuts, and bearings Attach all 4 bearings, paying attention to the direction of the bolt heads (for Z clearance). Snug these up, 7in/lbs, just past seated. Core Clamps \u00b6 For each Core Clamp printed part you will also need 2 bolts, 2 nuts, and 2 bearings. The bolt head direction and the part orientation are easy to miss. Pay attention to the pictures to make sure you don\u2019t have clearance issues later. This first one is the Core Clamp Y . The flat side faces towards the logo and needs to be in this location. The Core ClampY is specifically made to clear a bolt head on the Truck. Two bearings are at an angle between the Core and Core Clamp. Insert the top bearing and bolt first, then the bottom. Note Don\u2019t miss these two bearings. Add All 4 sets. Snug up all these bolts, 7in/lbs, just past seated. Do not crush the 1mm spacers. Double check the part orientation. Flat sides of the Core Clamps face away from each other. Notice where the Core ClampY part is located. Tip The holes in the Core Clamps are just for you to mount things if you need a spot. The holes fit M5s (or cable ties). Gantry Rail Tension Bolts \u00b6 4 bolts and bearings Slide a bearing in the Core Clamps. The bolt heads should all be up - let gravity keep them in place. Do not use a nut yet. All 4 bolt heads up, no nuts yet. Setting the Gantry Rails \u00b6 You will need a rail and nuts for each tension bolt. Slide the rail in the assembly. The rail should have slight tension and feel good with no nuts in place. All the bearings should be making contact. If your rail is loose or too tight there could be other issues. At this point, put the nuts on. Carefully seat the nuts just to lock in the current tension. A very light touch is needed here. You will be coming back to these so just seat the bolts and nuts. The rails should have a slight drag and feel the same with and without the nuts in place. Tip More tension is not better. Too loose and too tight are bad. If your rails did not have a good feeling tension like the Trucks in the earlier steps please stop and ask in the forums for help. If the rails feel really tight before adding the tension nuts with the rail in place loosen and tighten the two other nuts and bolts in each Core Clamp. This can give extra room if needed. Truck Locks \u00b6 Add both gantry rails. The open face of the Core should face the 0,0 corner (left nearest corner). Info Because of the asymmetry of the Trucks, if the Core doesn\u2019t point to 0,0, the work area will be smaller. Snug up the Truck Clamps. There is a gap here, same as the clamping parts. Do not try to close the gap. No need to stop the rails from rotating but there should be resistance. Leadscrew Nut \u00b6 You will need the brass T8 lead screw nut and two M3x10 screws. The nut has, and needs, some wiggle room. Seat two of the screws and then back them off about \u00bd turn. You should just be able to move the nut forward and backwards but not up and down. Tip This has to move to help with the Z screw alignment. Too tight and you can get binding. Another tip is to screw them in as shown in the picture, then move the nut back (away from them). If you find you are getting some binding try moving the screws to the back instead.

No need for NEMA 23\u2019s or their required larger drivers, torque is not one of this machines issues. Belts are used for there accuracy and price. Small belts are used because each axis has two of them. Ballscrews are expensive, require tuning, and periodic maintenance / adjustments. Control \u00b6 This is all controlled by any control board you like. The UltiMachine boards are recommended for the improved design and robust safety features.

If you use dual endstop firmware you will be able to dial this in even further. Machine accuracy is much easier to achieve with the Primo version. Test \u00b6 An easy test is to measure and compare the Trucks as they sit. You should have no belts attached at this point. Move the gantry around by hand, and place it roughly in the center of your work area. Measure each Truck pair without moving the gantry in the process. Measure the other Truck. Test both pairs of Trucks. Move the gantry around and test all four again. The numbers should be very close to the first test. Adjust \u00b6 Start with whichever gantry rail has the most error. Tightening a Core Clamp will move the rail and Truck away from that bolt. The outer Core Clamps have the largest effect. Use small adjustments. 1/16 th of a turn at a time. After each adjustment move the gantry around and test the Truck pair distances again. Repeat this a few times. Tip This should be very small adjustments and you are looking to get them within 1mm. If you over tighten them they stop moving. So if the Trucks are showing no effect, loosen the tension bolts all the way and start again. The minimum tension was set in the Core building step, so you will begin by tightening the clamps. At some point you can also loosen them a bit for the opposite effect.

You should have no belts attached at this point. Move the gantry around by hand, and place it roughly in the center of your work area. Measure each Truck pair without moving the gantry in the process. Measure the other Truck. Test both pairs of Trucks. Move the gantry around and test all four again. The numbers should be very close to the first test.","title":"Test"},{"location":"mpcnc/squaring/#adjust","text":"Start with whichever gantry rail has the most error. Tightening a Core Clamp will move the rail and Truck away from that bolt. The outer Core Clamps have the largest effect. Use small adjustments. 1/16 th of a turn at a time. After each adjustment move the gantry around and test the Truck pair distances again. Repeat this a few times. Tip This should be very small adjustments and you are looking to get them within 1mm. If you over tighten them they stop moving. So if the Trucks are showing no effect, loosen the tension bolts all the way and start again. The minimum tension was set in the Core building step, so you will begin by tightening the clamps. At some point you can also loosen them a bit for the opposite effect.

Printed Truck and Truck Mirrored parts. Tension Bolts \u00b6 Insert the bearings in the Truck and fit the bolts. Just seat the locknuts, they will get adjusted later. Leave them loose. Note Pay attention to the direction of the bolt heads on these two tension bolts. Stationary Bearings \u00b6 Fit the last 3 bearings and bolt sets. Notice the bolt orientation, nuts towards the rails. Snug these up. About 7in/lbs. Caution Using ratchets makes over tightening the bolts very easy. There are small 1mm built in spacers in the printed parts, if you crush these you are about 3x too tight. Loose is better than tight, If you work on your own car it is wayyyyyy less that any bolt you have ever tightened. Set The Truck Tension \u00b6 Insert a rail into the Truck. You are looking for all bearings to make contact and just a hint of tension. If you tip the rail at a 45 degree angle the Trucks should slowly move. Too tight and they will stay, too loose and they will drop right off. Tension both bolts evenly - for a new print this should actually just be good with no extra tension needed. If this is the case just snug up the tension bolts until the heads and nuts are touching the plastic. Holding not adding to the current tension. Caution If you have to really torque down on these bolts you could have the wrong sized rails or parts. The same thing applies if they are too tight, although you can let them sit overnight with no tension on the bolts to see if they loosen up a bit. Truck Clamp \u00b6 You will need the printed Truck Clamps. M5 x 30mm screw and lock nut. #2 screwdriver. Leave these loose, just engaging the nylocks. The rail will be added later. Tip For all the screws with captured nuts it is best to prethread them to loosen them up a bit to prevent ruining the printed parts. Belts and Idlers \u00b6 You will need two idlers for each Truck. Two M5 screws and nuts. #2 screw driver. Tip If you add the belts first it is easier than trying to fish them through later. Each axis has a mirrored set of Trucks, so that is an easy way to also pair up the belts. Tuck in the idlers into the pocket in the Trucks. Tighten the screws just tight enough to seat the nut all the way then back off a \u00bd turn. Ensure the idlers are free spinning. Pulleys \u00b6 Steppers Pulleys Wire Darryl / pulley spacer (optional) Loctite You can use the Wire Darryl to set the pulley height or just do it by eye in the next step.

The Bundle has all the hardware and electronics except the conduit/rails which are cheaper to source locally than to ship \u2013 $271 + shipping if international. 20\u2032 of Conduit \u2248$12 (or stainless steel tubing for a little more \u2248$43) . Plastic parts, filament, less than 2 spools \u2248$30 if you own a 3D printer, if not buy it from here for $135. Tool. Either a Dewalt , import spindle or an extruder (3D Printer) $53, or anything else you might want to bolt on, laser, drag knife , foam cutting needle (awesome), ect. Total Cost\u2026 if you have a 3D printer Under $370 , $475 if you buy the printed parts from here. I would like to drive that price home one more time, you can have a CNC router for precision work ( here , here all the way up to aluminum milling and plasma cutting steel for $486. That is all you need to spend, throw in a few endmills and you are still under $500. There is no other machine more versatile than the Mostly Printed CNC at any price point. Specs\u2026 \u00b6 Not easy to make a specs page when it can have most any specs you want. The idea behind this is to be extremely adaptable and inexpensive. Why buy a single use machine when you can have one that does it all for less than the cost of any single function machine. No proprietary hardware or software, build it any size and shape you want (more on this later), buy it from this site or source it all yourself, helpful forums, low cost, and capable. What more could you ask for? This machine can easily do many things, how about making some coffee with Apach\u2026(not me but I think he is my new hero). Size \u00b6 All axis can be any length you prefer, anything over 3 \u00bd\u2032 (1M) would require small mid-span supports to increase rigidity, of course smaller is better. The kit comes with enough belt for up to 48\u2033 of total outer X and Y axis dimensions (eg 24\u2033x24\u2033, 36\u2033x12\u2033 or any other combination). The smaller you make this the faster you can move it and the more rigid/accurate it will be, and more importantly the easier it will be to get the desired accuracy. The linear motion is ball bearings on electrical conduit (or stainless steel)\u2026 seriously, easy to use and source. More information on this here . If this machine isn\u2019t big enough I have also designed the LowRider CNC , all the same specs and resolution just designed to be bigger! Power \u00b6 X and Y axis are powered by 2 stepper motors each, and a single stepper for the Z axis. The standard would be NEMA 17 in any torque preferably 42 OZ/in and above (the kit come with 76 OZ/in). No need for NEMA 23\u2019s or their required larger drivers, torque is not one of this machines issues. Belts are used for there accuracy and price. Small belts are used because each axis has two of them. Ballscrews are expensive, require tuning, and periodic maintenance / adjustments. Control \u00b6 This is all controlled by any control board you like. The UltiMachine boards are recommended for the improved design and robust safety features. You can still use the common Ramps 1.4 or any others boards as well. There are other Marlin based boards, GRBL , and regular CNC boards as well. Software \u00b6 There are plenty of free or really inexpensive software options available for 3D printing, CAM, and CAD. I suggest Fusion 360 , Repetier-host , ESTLCam , ect. DIY \u00b6 Besides using either common imperial or metric hardware, the rest of the machine is easily 3D printable, RepRap style! Full list of hardware here , and the files for the printed parts can be had here .

Tension Bolt \u201cB\u201d \u00b6 This step uses the XY, XYZ, Lock Nut, 5\u2033 (M8 x 130) bolt, 2 bearing, both gantry spacers, and a nut. The 5\u2033 (M8 X 130) bolt goes through the XYZ plate.

Tension bolts \u201cC\u201d should have the locknuts and the bolt heads tightened so they are just touching the plastic.

If they are already loose tightening them slightly moves the rail away from the tension bolt. I\u2019m sorry there is no magic bullet for this part. For most people this should go together square as is, but if you are having issues you might just want to run it as is for a while and then try again after it has been broken in a bit.

You will see lots of images of people attaching cable chains, wires, and vacuum hoses to the motor mount. This is the absolute worst place on the entire machine to attach anything! It will act as a torque multiplier and completely ruin your accuracy/precision. Anything necessary should be attached to the main gantry assembly there is lots of room on the XYZ piece. The tool mount piece uses either #6 lock nuts or M4. Insert the nuts facing the right direction and if they are not a snug fit a tiny drop of glue in the corner will keep them from falling out. I add one after they are inserted right at the corner of each nut just to be safe. I use cyanoacrylate gel. It is not doing anything other making sure they do not fall out when not in use, if they are in use they do not depend on the glue at all. Insert the 4 nuts into the nut traps, if they aren\u2019t a tight fit a drop of glue here will help in assembly later. Insert the nut traps into your cut and drilled Z rails, pointed end up. Align the holes. Get all four screws \u00be\u2033 (M4 X 20) started but leave them extremely loose for a later alignment step. Press the bearing into the Z-Lower bracket. Make sure it is seated all the way and not crooked. Tighten the coupler onto the shaft, first tighten grub screw on the stepper shaft flat spot, then the grub screw on the round part. Make sure the shaft is most of the way into the coupler as shown in the cutaway. Use 3 M3x10mm screws to attach the stepper to the Z-Motor bracket. Do not insert the Lead Screw yet. The picture is to show you how far the shaft should be set. Use no screws on the Z mounts yet. Slide the Z-lower bracket onto the z rails open bearing side will face away from the tool mount. Slide it all the way to just above the tool mount. Next add the motor mount. This step lets you align the rails and snug up the tool mount 4 screws \u00be\u2033 (M4 X 20). Snug, if you hear a crack you went overboard. Slide the lower tool mount to where it just touches the coupler but does not compress it at all. IMPORTANT STEP Make sure the coupler touches the bearing so it can support the weight of the tool. We are using the ball bearing as a thrust bearing (not the right type of bearing but it is a tiny load). At this point hang the assembly off the edge of a table. Make sure the rails are sitting flat on the table, if it is not loosen, push down on the rails, and tighten the toolmount screws. If the rails are twisted it will rock back and forth\u2026that is bad. Try to get the gap between mounts to be relatively equal while still touching the coupler and bearing. This dimension will be different for every build. Check again, are the rails still flat? Add the screws \u00be\u2033 (M4 X 20) and nuts to the Z brackets, snug slightly. Snug slightly means, less than you think . If it is too loose at some point the mounts could move up and is very easily noticed and is easily fixed by going a very tiny bit more snug. If they are too tight you will crack the mount, not easily fixed. Err on the side of too loose. Check again, are the rails still sitting flat? Add the lead screw into the coupler. The lead screw should touch the motor shaft to fight thrust in the other direction from the lower mount bearing. Again, not the best engineering solution but it works great with this light load. The lead screw should be at least as long as the calculator specifies, but no longer than the bottom of the Z rails. If you are having a hard time getting the lead screw through the bearing, lightly sand or file the top 25mm (1\u2033) or so of the lead screw. It can be a tight fit. Lube the lead screw.

You might need its included drivers, so it is best to let them install. MAC User? -IT should work as is but here is some info if you find you are having issues you might need to change the firmware baud rate and perhaps a different driver. Firmware \u00b6 If you bought a system from me the firmware is pre-loaded and you do not need to make any changes. Marlin is the firmware currently used and it is pre-flashed on the control board included in the kit ( download the pre-configured files here ). If you are building your own feel free to use any board/firmware you want. Testing \u00b6 Never plug or unplug anything into the control board while there is any power, usb or power plug! It is best to start with Repetier-Host It is an easy program to use (do not use repetier server), just in case here is a basic set up . Move your gantry to the center of your build space and make sure the z axis is roughly centered in its travel. You never know which way it\u2019s going to go! With all the motors plugged in, plug in the USB cable and the power to the control board and hit connect in the upper left corner of repetier, it should take a few seconds and turn green to indicate it is connected. Note If you are using a dual end stop firmware flashed board, you have to have the end stops properly connected first, Info . If you have a series flashed board no end stops are needed. You can now use the control in the manual tab to move the machine. The arrows allow for .1, 1, 10, 50mm movements. Start small 1 mm at a time. The arrows should move it in that direction. X positive (Right arrow) should move Right , X negative should move Left, Y positive (up arrow) is back or away from you , Y negative is towards you. Z positive (Z up arrow) moves the z axis up , meaning the tool away from the work surface. If it doesn\u2019t move as expected hit disconnect, unplug the power and usb, any axis that is moving the wrong way simply flip the plug . If one stepper is moving the wrong way power down and flip it\u2019s plug. Power back up and test again. Control Software \u00b6 Now that your machine can talk to your computer you need to be able to control it. You can either use an lcd screen or control software. For the beginners software is usually easier to learn than the LCD screen. This can move the machine along any of the three axis and can also send gcode generated in any program (estlcam, slic3r, Image2Gcode, Fusion360, etc.). Repetier-Host is an easy program to use, here is a basic set up . You can also use Pronterface, Matter Control, ESTLCAM, or many others. Again for the beginners, start with repetier-host (not server). CNC Step 1 \u2013 First Use \u00b6 Now the machine should be moving around and once you finally get bored of manually moving it around it is time to put it to work. Let\u2019s start with ESTLCAM I have put together a little walk through using Estlcam as a plotter. So strap on a pen , (or a \u201cspindle\u201d if you know what you\u2019re doing).

F-Engrave Settings \u00b6 Here are some working F-Engrave settings: The first part that you are creating is the \u201cfemale\u201d part, this is pocket that will accept the inlay or \u201cmale\u201d part. To create the \u201cmale\u201d part you will need to mirror the image in F-Engrave, select Prismatic and Add Box on the V-carve settings. Then you will repeat the process of creating the gcode files for the \u201cmale\u201d part. This may look odd but it will fit snugly into the \u201cfemale\u201d part. Post Processing with MODfef \u00b6 Start MODfef and process the output files from F-engrave \u00b6 Select the MAIN file, the \u201cVCLEAN\u201d file and the \u201cCLEAN\u201d file You can also select a custom start file and end file (these are not produced by F-engrave) You can select the file extension for your gcode file You can enter a tool change line. The program will insert a pause here so you can change your cutter on the machine. You can enter the character that should be used for comments. F-engrave will enclose comments in parentheses () by default. You can choose if you want the files to be concatenated. If you select this it will make one file with a tool change. The output file will have the same name as the \u201cMAIN\u201d file but with your new extension. The concatenated file will contain the \u201cSTART\u201d file (if one is selected), then the \u201cMAIN\u201d file, then the \u201cVCLEAN\u201d file (if one is selected), then the tool change, then the \u201cCLEAN\u201d file (if one is selected), then the \u201cEND\u201d file (if one is selected). Carving \u00b6 Load the MODfef processed gcode file into Octoprint (or your gcode streamer) Select appropriate wood for the inlay Choose contrasting wood for the male and female parts The male part is wood that will be inlayed. The female part is the wood that will have the inlay glued into it. Set up the work piece for the female part, remember that your origin is set to the middle of the inlay. Set up the V cutter first. Cut the female part. If you have clean up files you will need to do a tool change, the system should just pause and allow you to complete that. Set up the flat end mill that you specified in F-Engrave and complete the \u201cfemale\u201d part. Once its complete, remove the \u201cfemale\u201d part and replace it with the \u201cmale\u201d (inlay) wood. Set up the V cutter again and set your origin over the center of the wood. Cut the male part. Once more if you have clean files you may have a tool change. Its the same process that you completed with the \u201cfemale\u201d part. Clean up and Assembly \u00b6 Once its complete clean up both parts. I use a scalpel to clean any edges or corners that need it. I also remove any burs that may be present. I dry fit them to see that the gap between the male and female parts are consistent. If it doesn\u2019t look right using some color on the inlay protrusions during a dry fit can help to show where the parts are interfering. Glue the parts together I use regular wood glue and leave it to dry overnight It is important to clamp the parts evenly as you can influence the fit which will spoil the inlay effect. Trim the excess from the inlay (male part) I usually do this on the band saw but you can do it with any tool that will remove the excess wood without dislodging the inlay. Sand the part down until the inlay is flush There is normally quite a bit of inlay wood to be removed, some form of belt sander works very well here. Finish the part with the appropriate finish It depends on the type of wood you have chosen. Select a finish that will work with both the female wood and the male wood.

You should have a firm grasp on the basics before trying this. This is how to manually set up a 2.5D cut, the alternative would be to import an STL file and let ESTLCAM choose the paths. The automatically generated STL paths took 50 minutes to cut and did not pick up the small 4mm hole. The following manual paths took 18 minutes to cut and look fantastic! So I can show some different techniques in this walk though I am using piece of Brazilian Ipe that has an uneven top surface, so no reliable Z origin. I will use the bed as the start position and tell ESTLCAM the work surface is slightly higher than measured on the thickest part of the wood. This will allow me to easily surface the uneven wood and not have to estimate where the origin should be. The tool paths start with importing the DXF file in mm. This file has all the part paths on it but not the depth of cut so we will work though this on step at a time. The tool will be starting off to the left of the actual piece of wood touching the bed so the first step is to move the zero point over about half an inch, to approximate where the tool will start. Just select Zero, Point, and Click where you want the new Zero. These are the dimension I will be using for the depths of cut. The first cutting step will be the basic surfacing of the wood to make sure the top is nice and flush. I don\u2019t have much thickness to spare so for surfacing I am only cutting 1.55mm in to the work surface. Because I am starting from the bed the Z origin will be set at the end when ESTLCAM asks for the part height, that will be the Z zero plane (I will be using 11.5mm). So for this part my Z=0 will be 11.5mm from the bed surface. If you had a nice flat piece of material you can make it easier and just start at the work surface. For the cut I select Inside, pocket , and selected the outer most path, shown in red. Make sure to set the tool path depth and machining order starting at one and increment by at least one. The next cut will be a pocket taking the whole surface down in 2 steps, a rough and finishing pass. For the roughing we can start at 1.55mm from the Z=0 plane since that material is already gone from the previous step and go into the material another 4.85mm as see in the part dimensions. For the roughing pass we will leave an allowance of 0.2mm. This lets us come back round for a second pass and only have to mill of .2mm of wood and this leaves a nice smooth Finished surface. So we use an inside pocket pass with .2mm allowance and then a second just inside cut with 0 allowance since the material has already been removed with the roughing pocket no need to cut all that empty space. Current tool path shown in red. Again, always set the machining order. This new pocket will be the depth at which we start the rest of the cuts (6.4mm) Next will be the 4mm hole. We can use a Helical path and start from 6.4mm deep and go a little into the spoil board, I went an extra .2mm for a cut of 5.3mm Now 3 more inside cuts, rough pockets followed by finishing passes. Now that the inner features have been finished it is time to cut the part from the material, leaving 3 small tabs that can easily but snipped off. For this step will will be using an outside cut, with a .2mm allowance, setting the tabs, starting at the Z=0 plane since the outer edge did not get surfaced and cutting .2mm in to the waste board (11.7mm deep). Then the finishing pass with 0 allowance and matching the tabs previously set. Now save your project in case you need to come back and edit your paths. You can do this by using the select tool and changing the popup box parameters. Then export your CNC program (gcode). I use repetier as my visualizer to make sure the cuts look like they should, but to catch small errors if you are new to this I always suggest cutting into high density foam the first run to test your path. Better to waste some time and foam than stress your machine, break a bit, and waste material with some bad gcode. This leaves me with fairly finished part. I can pop it out and use a razor knife to cut off the tabs. I then hit the edges lightly with some 220 git sand paper and call it a day.

EstlCAM is for generating GCode. This software seems to do everything I want. It also seems to be translated into every language I\u2019ve ever heard of, if not you can add translations in the software. The installer is in German I think but the options are easy to understand. Please buy a copy if you find this works for you. Step one \u2013 Install Estlcam \u00b6 Install Estlcam. Using the default options in the installer, add Icon to start menu and desktop. The first window that pops up I set the language, change the display units, and set it to show the feed rate in mm/s on the tool popups. After you click okay close Estlcam and restart it to update the settings. Step 2 \u2013 Setup \u00b6 After restarting Estlcam, open the setup tab, these are the settings from the first window plus a few extra. Changing the clearance plane to something a little smaller really speeds up a job since the z axis is the slowest. This is how far above the material it should travel to before it moves. You should change the milling direction depending on what kind of material you are cutting, more on this in another post. Setting the z-axis origin to the top of the material makes it easy to set the home position, along with that is program start \u2013 at origin. Choosing to end the program \u201cabove origin\u201d is safe, \u201cabove last position\u201d is the fastest. The creator of Estlcam recently updated his software for us! In the CNC Program Generation tab, choose Marlin (if you are using my firmware). Important \u2013 Set feed unit to mm/min- (this is what the marlin firmware needs). Change the file extension \u201cgcode\u201d so all the programs recognize it. Next up is the travel feed rates. 2100/60=35mm/s, 480=8mm/s (keep the Z low) I delete all the default tools and use this as a conservative test speed setting for an \u215b\u2033 flat endmill in wood. Do not exceed 8mm/s in the z plunge field unless you know what you are doing and know what firmware limits you have. You are ready to generate some GCode. Step 3 \u2013 2D gcode, Good for pen plotting or 2D milling (cutting things out) \u00b6 Grid Size. DXF files are crazy sizes sometimes so to make sure your DXF is the right size change the grid. Found in View>Grid I set mine to 10mm or 25.4mm=1in. For this 2D or 2.5D work .DXF files are used. You can use any vector program to make them, illustrator, SolidWorks, etc. Get some files from here, (Need a new source, sorry). I used this one in the video , Crown Vector . Open DXF. File>Open \u2013 If your DXF is completely the wrong size try again with different initial units. This is what the crown looks like imported in inches as the initial units. This is whatever units you save your DXF as. Step 4 \u2013 Scale / Re-Zero \u00b6 The crown imported at about 55mm wide I want about 150mm wide. Select>Resize>Drawing Layers , then click on the DXF to select it. I scaled the crown 250x to get it to 150mm (5 \u00be\u2033). Zoom out to see your DXF. Zero>Create arbitrary point , then select outside of the DXF paths. This is how to set your origin (or Home). The little blue plus symbol is what your machine sees as 0,0 (x=0, y=0, generally the lower left corner of your work). When you start your program the machine will work to the right and above where you start it from (represented by the blue plus). Some people like to work from the center for round or oval objects. Step 5 \u2013 Select the tool paths \u00b6 To use the pen you want to drawn on the line so use engrave (tool centered on line), if you were cutting a part you can choose part (tool edge on the outside of line), or cutout (tool edge in inside of line). Click Engrave then just click on each line segment. Step 6 \u2013 Save \u00b6 Export. File>Save CNC Program . Give it a name. You will get a depth popup, for the pen I use 1mm or less, anything else set it to the thickness of your material plus a bit to cut all the way through. You can then preview the path. Step 7 \u2013 Control Software \u00b6 Open repetier-host . load the .gcode (or .nc , .ngc) file you just saved. If you have the bed size adjusted you can get a sense of scale. If you can\u2019t see the lines check the box Print Preview>Show Travel moves. View it from the edge and you can see, that the path is below your z-home, and the movements are above z-home. Don\u2019t pay any attention as to where it is shown on the bed. It will start where ever your head currently is. Step 8 \u00b6 Start. Put the tip of the pen (or tool) a hair above where you want it to start and hit run. It should pick up, move, drop down and go. If it goes down first and doesn\u2019t pick up between moves your z axis is backwards. Flip the plug . Test File \u00b6 Test Crown 12mm/s \u2013 If you are having problems try this one (If you are having download issues -Right click- Save as.). Final \u00b6 This all it takes to plot with a pen or do basic 2D (2.5D) milling, some of the most common things this type of mill is used for. Make sure to adjust your tool and its settings depending on the material in use. Always do a test cut! Here is an old video, the new pen holder has a built in spring so you will get even more consistent results.","title":"EstlCAM Setup"},{"location":"software/estlcam-basics/#estlcam-basics","text":"Estlcam is found here.

First take the protective cover off of the carbide knife Carefully position it into the cutter body, no need to push a magnet should suck it in. Then use the screw on the end to adjust it so it sticks out the approximate thickness of your material. It isn\u2019t much, more than paper, less than a credit card. Warning Do not touch the end that little knife will slice you very quickly. The button on the end is to push the blade out for removal. Set the Depth Of Cut \u00b6 Try and hold the cutter as perpendicular to the work material as possible and draw a circle on a hard flat smooth surface, glass or similar. If you go through the paper like the second photo you are much too deep, adjust the blade and locking ring again. Keep adjusting and drawing circles to get the depth right. The third picture looks close but if you look at the paper backing in the 4 th picture it is still a bit too deep. Ideal Depth \u00b6 What you are looking for is all the way through the material and a slight dent in the paper backing, but not a cut. It can be tricky if you have never done it before but with a little practice it only takes a try or two. The blade is barely visible. The depth will change depending on your material but you are always looking to just barely leave a mark on the carrier material.

Please clip the ends\u2026.pet peeve\u2026 Two screws on to the MPCNC, ready for action. The Machine \u00b6 The least expensive solution I could find for a nice cutting surface was a cheap 1\u2032 square mirror. Just make sure to set your blade depth correctly, pretty sure the carbide can score the glass and make for a dangerous experience. Tape on all sides is more than enough, there is very little force when it is all set up nicely. The Software \u00b6 I used Estlcam for this sticker. There are other vinyl cutting specific software but, Estlcam works well enough. I think the option for over cuts might be in Estlcam but the lead in works to prevent small tags keeping the part in from the blade offset. Open your dxf of choice and make sure the size is as expected. My grid is set at 25.4mm so this sticker will be about 3\u2033. Engrave would be the idea path option for this but I want to use the lead in so I set the tool diameter as small as permitted, 0.1mm. Select the path with either inside or outside tool. Use the \u201clead in\u201d button to get close to a path overlap. This makes sure the sticker has been completely cut out. I want this as a acid mask so I chose to lead in from the inside of the design. Set the other path. Save the program, chose something small for the depth of cut. For this 0.2mm was used. Run the Gcode \u00b6 You can either load the .gcode into repetier host or save it to an SD card and run it from the LCD. Secure your vinyl/material to your cutting surface. I use painters tape on all sides and try to get the material to lay as flat and taught as possible. I use vinyl similar to this, http://amzn.to/2eHGbJU , I prefer medium tack for easy release. Move the gantry/cutter to the home position, and set the drag knife in contact with the material. Lowering it just enough to just engage the mount spring. Start the program.

The positive is a typical sticker, the negative is my acid mask. Apply a piece of the transfer tape on the surface, trying to minimize bubbles between layers, not a big deal just best practice. Easiest way is to oversize the transfer tape and use it to tape it to a glass surface. You can do multiple \u201cstickers\u201d at once. trim the transfer tape and the backing at the same time. Bonus points for using a straight edge\u2026 Applying a vinyl sticker \u00b6 Peel the backing paper off. Stick the vinyl and transfer tape to a clean surface. Carefully peel the transfer tape off, pulling at a 90 angle is best practice. Enjoy! Acid Etching Glass \u00b6 Make sure to clean the glass surface thoroughly. Peel the backing and apply the mask from the center for easier alignment. stick down one side from the center out, then the other side. Peel off the transfer tape and make sure all edges are completely stuck so acid can not get under it. I use this acid, http://amzn.to/2fpM1zK .

This tool does exactly that, much cheaper (and more safely) than a laser. It\u2019s basically a very fast reciprocating needle \u2013 like a sewing machine \u2013 mounted on your CNC machine. Pin a sheet of foam board onto the bed of your CNC, load in the plane\u2019s gcode, set the origin, and start the machine. Twenty minutes or so later you have a sheet of parts that are accurately cut, easily punched out, and hot-glued together. Score cuts are no problem. You can build the cutter for about $20 , but you probably have some of the parts already. Description \u00b6 The needle is formed from a length of 0.5mm (0.025\u201d) music-wire and attached to a small ball-bearing mounted eccentrically on the flywheel. The flywheel is mounted on the shaft of a 2212 (stator size) brushless motor (with ESC and servo tester) and spun to create one stroke/perforation every revolution. The needle is guided by the nozzle from a MIG welder, and helped to stay straight by guide bearings. It helps to sharpen the end of the needle by rotating it at 45 degrees to an abrasive wheel. Speeds \u00b6 The important number to remember is that you need 10-15 strokes/mm to cut cleanly and limit the load on the needle, i.e. feedrate (mm/min) of ONE-TENTH the cutter speed . At 8000-10000 rpm you can use a feed rate of 600-1000 mm/min to cleanly cut DollarTree foam board (paper on), blue-cor fanfold foam, etc. in about 20 minutes. At higher speeds, the MIG tip may heat up and melt the plastic mount, and the bending load on the needle can break it at the top. If your flywheel is poorly balanced and needs to run at lower speed, reduce the feedrate accordingly. Components \u00b6 A MPCNC can be built large enough to handle a 510x750mm (20\u201dx30\u201d) sheet of foam board, but it won\u2019t be stiff enough to mill aluminum. A LowRider can easily handle this size, is cheaper to build, and can be rolled aside when not in use to leave most of your bench for other work. There\u2019s also the ERC TimSav machine and moebeast\u2019s Foam Ripper , which are even cheaper and simpler, but harder to use for other things. Everyone uses fairly large motors, although the actual power used is very low, around 10-20W. This is largely historical, but it is useful to have a motor with a short shaft and threaded holes to bolt on the flywheel. To minimise vibration, you want the ecentric needle bearing fairly close to the motor bearing. Long shafts and collet adapters will require lower speeds. Motors of around 1000-1200kV work well. Faster motors need to run at very low throttle, where ESC and servo testers may have poor resolution, and the RPM may hunt or surge. The (3mm inside diameter) bearings can be harvested from broken motors, or a pack of 10 is about $2 on ebay. Washers must be small enough to not touch the outside (moving) part of the bearing. You can either start with smaller (M2.5) washers, super-glue them to some scrap wood and drill them out to 3mm, or start with 3mm washers, clamp them to a bolt and hold that in a cordless drill and run them against an abrasive wheel. There are various ways to attach the needle to the top bearing, but by far the easiest is the 3D printed collar in moebeast\u2019s Foam Ripper An alternative is to enclose the bearing in the flywheel, with a free-wheeling bolt. Attaching the needle to the bolt is much easier than to a smooth bearing. The Onshape model (for a 2822 motor) is public and can be accessed here . You will probably need to adjust it to get a good fit to your motor. More photos and a description are here Files \u00b6 There are two popular versions: ERC-MPCNC Needle Cutter jhitesma\u2019s Needle Cutter Here\u2019s a parametric CAD drawing of the second, which can be easily edited to suit different motors in the browser based OhShape (note that you can see and use other people\u2019s modifications): New cutter 525 mount Cutting procedure \u00b6 Place the material. Position the cutting head over the origin (front left corner of the board) Start the shop-vac. Start the cutter motor. Wind the Z-axis down until you can hear it just touch the surface. Select print file from the SD card. Vacuum hold down \u00b6 It is important that the foam board does not move during the cutting process. Pins and tape can work, but ideally you should have a fixed frame, into which the board fits. Foam board is also often bowed, and the cutter works best when it is flat (and score cuts require a predictable depth). The vacuum pad solves both problems. The vacuum pad consists of three sheets of DTFB (Dollar Tree Foam Board): two slotted sheets (glued together) with a loose \u201choles\u201d sheet that serves as the replaceable spoilboard. The 3-layer stack sits on the work surface, with nothing between, and the vacuum pad not only pulls down the foam workpiece but also pulls itself down against the work surface. The shop-vac noise can be reduced with an inexpensive router speed control to reduce the speed. Use full power for a second to suck the work down, then reduce to minimum power. Here are DXF plans for the 3 sheet pad - although you need a working needle cutter to use them. It may be easier and faster to cut the first two with a craft knife, and use the machine to make the grid of holes in the third sheet. Moebeast\u2019s Foam Ripper contains an STL for the manifold vacuum nozzle, or you can build a square funnel shape from foam board.

These are not assembled by me so a few extra minutes starting from scratch can save a lot of headaches in the end. Start by screwing the base plate to the stepper with the M3x6 screw. I prefer to have the wires oriented up. On the Tension arm add the bearing and broad headed screw. If the bearing does not spin freely, flip it over. One side is slightly offset. Make sure the bearing spins free and smoothly. Some sets include a washer, use it if you have it. Threadlocker is a good idea as well. Add the tension arm and bolt. Make sure the arm swivels smoothly. If the arm binds you can loosen the screw a bit. Thread locker is a good idea here as well. Add the pulley next. Usually the set/grub screws are positioned closer to the motor but not always. Center the teeth on the idler pulley and make certain the pulley does not hit the heat sink that gets installed later. Tighten the set screw on the stepper\u2019s flat spot if it has one, the the second screw. Double check the feed pulley to be sure the teeth are inline with the idler and the pulley does not hit the heat sink. Add the MicroSwiss throat and lock nut. This throat does not contain PTFE so it can handle higher temperatures and should not need any maintenance. To help with heat dissipation the lock nut is positioned on the inside of the bracket. Thread the throat is as far as it can go. Do not let the throat make contact with the idler or pulley. The smaller this gap the better soft and flexible filaments will print and the better the heat will dissipate from the throat when printing PLA slowly. Next up is the tension stack. The bottom screw helps to retain the spring (and is not always necessary). This should be the shorter of the two screws. If this screw is too long the arm will not open enough to insert filament. If that is the case don\u2019t use the screw or find a shorter one. The top screw controls the filament pinch tension, tighter is not better, you want just enough to feed without slipping. Tension stack completed. Start with little to no tension and only increase it if your filament slips. Double check the throat is not hitting the idler or pulley. The cooling stack. the screws may or may not have washers. Position the fan wires appropriately. Tighten with moderate tension. This is where a majority of the unwanted heat gets dissipated so tension is good fro heat transfer but too much will ruin the fan, so balance\u2026 The cooling stack completed.

These are not assembled by me so a few extra minutes starting from scratch can save a lot of headaches in the end. Start by screwing the base plate to the stepper with the M3x6 screw. I prefer to have the wires oriented up. On the Tension arm add the bearing and broad headed screw. If the bearing does not spin freely, flip it over. One side is slightly offset. Make sure the bearing spins free and smoothly. Some sets include a washer, use it if you have it. Threadlocker is a good idea as well. Add the tension arm and bolt. Make sure the arm swivels smoothly. If the arm binds you can loosen the screw a bit. Thread locker is a good idea here as well. Add the pulley next. Usually the set/grub screws are positioned closer to the motor but not always. Center the teeth on the idler pulley and make certain the pulley does not hit the heat sink that gets installed later. Tighten the set screw on the stepper\u2019s flat spot if it has one, the the second screw. Double check the feed pulley to be sure the teeth are inline with the idler and the pulley does not hit the heat sink. Add the MicroSwiss throat and lock nut. This throat does not contain PTFE so it can handle higher temperatures and should not need any maintenance. To help with heat dissipation the lock nut is positioned on the inside of the bracket. Thread the throat is as far as it can go. Do not let the throat make contact with the idler or pulley. The smaller this gap the better soft and flexible filaments will print and the better the heat will dissipate from the throat when printing PLA slowly. Next up is the tension stack. The bottom screw helps to retain the spring (and is not always necessary). This should be the shorter of the two screws. If this screw is too long the arm will not open enough to insert filament. If that is the case don\u2019t use the screw or find a shorter one. The top screw controls the filament pinch tension, tighter is not better, you want just enough to feed without slipping. Tension stack completed. Start with little to no tension and only increase it if your filament slips. Double check the throat is not hitting the idler or pulley. The cooling stack. the screws may or may not have washers. Position the fan wires appropriately. Tighten with moderate tension. This is where a majority of the unwanted heat gets dissipated so tension is good fro heat transfer but too much will ruin the fan, so balance\u2026 The cooling stack completed.

So straight 2 color images with no gradients are best. Just plain old black and white. The higher the resolution the sharper the edges. Resize and adjust \u00b6 Next is open the image in Photoshop (or any image editor Paint.net is a free alternative), then resize it match the size you need. It is best to set the pixel resolution in your image editor as well. I use 100 px/cm or 0.1mm. I find the best quality with my setup at that resolution. Typically, a higher resolution is recommended but I had unsatisfactory results. While in your editor you can also adjust your levels to make the whites as white as possible and the blacks as black as possible. Image2GCode \u00b6 After you have your image sized and ready to go open up Image2GCode and load your image. The linked version has been modified for the Mostly Printed CNC. Remember you are engraving the backside of the mirror so you have to flip your image horizontally so it appears the correct way on the front of the mirror. If you do not, it will be backwards and you will need to start over. You can also Turn the gamma way down too this will help darken the blacks more if need be. You want the laser blasting as strongly as possible on the mirror. Next on the Laser profile tab you want to leave Min Power at 0 and change Max Power to 255 or select the Max radio button. No other changes required to the defaults here. On the last and final GCODE tab there are a few changes I make here. In the Gcode header section I add the following code: G0 X0 Y0 M201 X1000 Y1000 M204 P1000 T1000 This code turns up the default MPCNC acceleration. You may need to tweak these settings for your machine, these work well for mine. Your feedrate may vary slightly depending on the finish of the mirror. A good starting point would be 1200 mm/min. Click the Use S Param radio button. Type 106 S in the Laser Power on MCODE box and type M107 in the Laser Power Off MCODE box. I like to use diagonal scanning for best quality.

These can and will blind and or burn you in less than 1/100 th of a second, It takes ten times that long to even react by blinking if it is in the visible spectrum. Did I make my point yet? Safety glasses are paramount. This is not the place to try and save money. You need a high quality pair and anyone else that could be around it needs the same quality. The cheaper your laser is the more money you will need to spend on the safety glasses. Import lasers are notorious for being dirty, mislabeled, and this makes them more dangerous. High quality lasers are of a known wavelength and strength therefore they are easy to protect yourself from, imports can contain other wavelengths that your goggles may or may not protect you from or be more powerful than your glasses are rated for. I am no expert, have no way of testing, and therefore no real say in who makes quality glasses, I can not make a recommendation at this time. This video might help drive home the point. While we are on the subject, the laser looks extremely harmless in the goggles, kids (and most adults) will try to take off the glasses immediately so no youngsters (or tough guys) unless the laser is fully enclosed behind a laser shield and you trust them to listen. In the glasses the laser is just a bright dot but you can see in your periphery the entire room lights up. You never know when the laser could hit something slightly reflective, your mount could fail, the gcode could cram it into the surface and break your mount, your air assist could drop into and reflect the beam sending send a death beam in any direction. Lungs & Skin \u00b6 The other end of the safety spectrum is the material you are working with. You can\u2019t just go etching and cutting things willy nilly. Ever think you could make chlorine gas or cyanide in your own house\u2026.now you can. Laser cutting vinyl or ABS plastic does just that. Two extremely common materials. Here is the list I refer to most often, if you have a link to a better guide please let me know. Best practice is to contain all the laser smoke and direct it through a filter and vent it outside, at the very least vent it outside. You do not want to breath any of the smoke any modern man made material makes. Fire \u00b6 Now this one might be a little bit of a surprise to some and obvious to others. Lasers are burning your material, add air assist directly to the burn zone and strong ventilation fans and you end up with the best recipe for fire ever. Pay close attention never leave it unattended and have the appropriate type of fire suppression on hand. Fire is not extremely common on good cuts but if it does happen it happens stupid fast with all that force fed oxygen. Basics \u00b6 Types \u00b6 Two of the most common lasers in the maker world are CO2 and Diode lasers. Diode lasers are much more compact, have self contained interchangeable optics, and are an order of magnitude lower power than a typical CO2 laser. More on the Power in a bit. These lasers operate at different wavelengths and this can have an effect of the type of material they are suitable for. Diode based lasers can range in price from a few dollars up to a few hundred, and CO2 based lasers start at a few hundred and go up from there. Both lasers have some sort of focal lens but a CO2 laser also has a mirror system to steer the beam before focus. Diodes can be cooled with a small fan, CO2 use water and sometimes a chiller. Typically on any of the V1 Engineering machines you would be using a diode based laser. If your goal is to cut wood or plastic you should be looking at a CO2 laser. A Diode is best at marking/etching, and is only capable of cutting light materials (foam, paper, plastic) and very thin wood. Power \u00b6 Laser power, not as straight forward as you would think. Higher numbers in general mean thicker materials can be cut or etching can be done faster. Numbers are not everything! A laser has four things to consider when talking about it\u2019s power; wattage, spot size, focal length, spectrum. Wattage The overall power output of your laser (like a light bulb, energy per time). On most non-laser specific machines we are limited by speed. Okay stick with me, just like strapping on a chainsaw motor to the MPCNC stronger is not always better. Since we can only move so fast before we start to get motion degradation you need to size your laser accordingly. A strong laser moving slowly will have an extremely limited range of grey levels. For example at the same speed a higher powered laser will have to use power 1-20 so you don\u2019t start a fire (19 levels of grey), but a lower powered laser will be able to use power 1-255 (254 levels of grey) without starting a fire. Make sense? Spot size How small of a spot the wattage is concentrated on. Spot size dictates the resolution of the image you can produce, think printer DPI (dots per inch). Another side effect of spot size can be ability to cut. A poorly focused laser\u2019s power is too spread out to be effective, a finely focused laser cuts significantly better. For a diode this can vary 100-400 micron in diameter just by laser wattage. To be more clear, more powerful diode lasers can not be focused to as small of a point as lower powered lasers (the source is not truly a point, larger diodes equal larger initial \u201cpoints\u201d, and it is not actually a spot but a rectangular spot). Focal length This influences the shape of the laser cone (long and narrow or short and fat). The focal length is dependent on the lens you use and should be a small range depending on the lens. If you have a choice, a longer focal length can aid in cutting ability (a thinner steeper beam/cone can cut deeper before power is lost to the edges of the material). Spectrum The wavelength of the light it produces (diodes-UV to viable, CO2- mid-infrared). Materials react differently to every spectrum as do safety glasses. If you have a specific need do your research before buying. Duty cycle One more thing on the topic of power, duty cycle or continuous time on. On the cheap import look out for sensational things like \u201c15W $50!\u201d somewhere in the description it could say \u201cOne second continuous operation time\u201d. This means they are over driving the heck out of the laser, it will not last long, and at 1 second bursts it is not very useful. Guard your wallet from these Scammy Chumps. I just found another ad that says no more than 30min continuous, that might sound like a lot at first but you can do some really detailed things that take a few hours. Air Assist \u00b6 To get cleaner etching, deeper cuts, and to save your lens you need some sort of air assist. While using your laser your material will produce smoke. This smoke if not directed away will stick to the material you are working with producing a sooty poor looking cut or etching. This smoke will also stick to the laser\u2019s lens and very quickly build up heat before you know it the lens will break. Bare minimum you need to have a 40mm fan clearing the area, even better are radial fans (higher pressure more direct), or even better yet a small compressor . If you have the ability to hook up your compressor and aim the air stream you can get significantly better cuts this way. Once again don\u2019t forget to vent your fumes safely and accordingly. The Hard Part \u00b6 Choosing \u00b6 Choosing which laser to buy can be the hardest part. If this all already seems overwhelming just buy a JTechPhotonics kit . Why; it is a trusted laser/company, glasses proven suitable for it, complete kits available, the only kit that is US legal , and the connections and use are as simple as it gets (more later). I think the 2W kits are a great deal. If you have other companies to suggest please let me know, and I will check them out. PWM, TTL, WTF? \u00b6 PWM, and TTL in this context are just how the power of the laser is controlled. All we really care about is if the laser is controlled by 5V or 12V. Good brands and companies make this abundantly clear, if you are buying an import this is by far the hardest part of the whole thing. The specs are not clear, the wiring diagrams are typically non-existent and if they are they can be wrong, we even have drivers with PCB\u2019s with misprinted polarity so you can\u2019t even follow that. Unfortunately import lasers, while super cheap, tend to be a guess and check game, both with connections and lens specs. With all common boards we can handle 12V and 5V signals, no big deal! 12V signal driven lasers are less common (Jtech). They are simple, you plug them into the print fan port (or any 12V port) on your control board and you are good to go. Using a 12V port you will typically use M106 SXXX to turn the laser on and M107 to turn the laser off. The Sxxx is the laser strength with a value between 0-255, 255 being the most power. 5V driven lasers need a firmware edit to assign the right pin for your board, this just reassigns the 12v fan pin to instead control a 5V pin. After that the same rules apply, use M106 SXXX to turn the laser on and M107 to turn the laser off. The Sxxx is the laser strength with a value between 0-255, 255 being the most power.

I just found another ad that says no more than 30min continuous, that might sound like a lot at first but you can do some really detailed things that take a few hours.","title":"Power"},{"location":"tools/lasers/#air-assist","text":"To get cleaner etching, deeper cuts, and to save your lens you need some sort of air assist. While using your laser your material will produce smoke. This smoke if not directed away will stick to the material you are working with producing a sooty poor looking cut or etching. This smoke will also stick to the laser\u2019s lens and very quickly build up heat before you know it the lens will break. Bare minimum you need to have a 40mm fan clearing the area, even better are radial fans (higher pressure more direct), or even better yet a small compressor . If you have the ability to hook up your compressor and aim the air stream you can get significantly better cuts this way. Once again don\u2019t forget to vent your fumes safely and accordingly.","title":"Air Assist"},{"location":"tools/lasers/#the-hard-part","text":"","title":"The Hard Part"},{"location":"tools/lasers/#choosing","text":"Choosing which laser to buy can be the hardest part. If this all already seems overwhelming just buy a JTechPhotonics kit .

I think the 2W kits are a great deal. If you have other companies to suggest please let me know, and I will check them out.","title":"Choosing"},{"location":"tools/lasers/#pwm-ttl-wtf","text":"PWM, and TTL in this context are just how the power of the laser is controlled. All we really care about is if the laser is controlled by 5V or 12V. Good brands and companies make this abundantly clear, if you are buying an import this is by far the hardest part of the whole thing. The specs are not clear, the wiring diagrams are typically non-existent and if they are they can be wrong, we even have drivers with PCB\u2019s with misprinted polarity so you can\u2019t even follow that. Unfortunately import lasers, while super cheap, tend to be a guess and check game, both with connections and lens specs. With all common boards we can handle 12V and 5V signals, no big deal! 12V signal driven lasers are less common (Jtech). They are simple, you plug them into the print fan port (or any 12V port) on your control board and you are good to go. Using a 12V port you will typically use M106 SXXX to turn the laser on and M107 to turn the laser off. The Sxxx is the laser strength with a value between 0-255, 255 being the most power. 5V driven lasers need a firmware edit to assign the right pin for your board, this just reassigns the 12v fan pin to instead control a 5V pin. After that the same rules apply, use M106 SXXX to turn the laser on and M107 to turn the laser off. The Sxxx is the laser strength with a value between 0-255, 255 being the most power. ( Thanks Guffy ) Rambo=45 Archim=53? MiniRambo=23 Ramps=44 Warning Marlin 2.0 specific- Currently M3 is not working with lasers, and we have a delay issue.

This subject can get very deep and intimidating so I will try and present this in a tiered manner. Improving as we learn collectively and as the software (CAM) improves. I am no expert. I learn by reading and trial and error. Test cuts speak volumes and should be considered a requirement. You should have test cuts that are small but representative of your part. If you are doing a 3D sculpt isolate a small part and mill it out, if you are cutting out a part with a pocket and some holes make a small part with a pocket and a hole. These test cuts can save hours on the actual job, every time you do one I promise you will learn something. Baby Steps \u00b6 You should have already done some plotting, as shown here . You should have a very clean drawing if you don\u2019t you should not be milling yet. Make sure the pen picks up all the way (clearance plane), and the parts are the right size. This ensure your machine works correctly and you are familiar with the basics of CAM and how your machine moves. After plotting the next step in milling would be HD foam , (I find it at the big box store \u201cfoamular\u201d $5 for a \u00bc sheet), this material holds amazing tolerances, mills very well, and will not destroy your machine when you make a mistake. If you are new this should always be the material you make a first test cut in, then on to test cuts in the material you want to use. You can make test cuts on both sides and the $5 it costs will pay for is self many times over in saved bits and refined CAM settings (time & accuracy). Some of the first cuts ever made on an MPCNC. For The Impatient \u00b6 If you just want to get the machine dirty here is the generic recipe. This should work in every material, you can optimize later. Single flute \u215b\u2033 upcut bit . 8mm/s Feed Rate (The speed at which you move through the material). 3mm/s Plunge Rate (The speed at which you move vertically into the material). 1mm Depth of Cut (The thickness of material your bit will be removing per pass). 45% Step Over (The percentage of bit diameter that should be in contact with the material) Use the Peel pocketing strategy. Always use a finishing pass of \u224810% of your tools diameter. The more dense the material the smaller the finishing pass. At this point you should be in HD foam, if that works out you can try some soft wood like pine. If that works at this point the only variable you should be changing is the depth of cut . You can vary this and it will increase the load on your machine in trade for more material removed per pass or decrease the load by taking shallower bites. Peel, Is usually the best pocketing strategy. When you get that out of your system come back and learn things a little more in depth. A More Proper Introduction \u00b6 These are some of the first things you should understand when just getting started. I am going to collect and link all the great resources I think illustrate the point the best. Most of these pictures should link to an outside site for more information. If you disagree with any of the following information please let me know\u2026politely. Islands \u00b6 An island is that pesky little thing in the center of a cut, like the middle on an \u201cO\u201d, or the center of the logo. Super easy only takes 3 steps. Using the Part tool select the inner feature. Next is the Hole tool, select the outer feature. Then in the Properties box select Island . Work offsets \u00b6 A work offset is simply moving your origin. This is typically used when there are more than one operation in your job, multiple fixtures can be used, locating pins, or other locating methods. More typically for us to avoid Negative X and Y moves when using endstops. Not Offset Offset (Good for Dual Endstops) Finishing Pass \u00b6 A finishing pass allows you to complete your job faster with more accuracy. What?! By leaving a bit of material on your roughing cut you can then cut off a very small amount of material leaving you with a very accurate final cut with a better surface finish. This means you can rough out your part faster (high machine loads increase deflection) and the finishing skim cut (extremely low machine loads) will bring it to final dimension. All cuts should have this, most importantly slotting operations. Just select your finishing tool, usually the current tool you are using. Shown in the yellow box. Use a 5-25% tool diameter allowance. Shown in the yellow box. The finishing pass is show in the picture as the lighter red path. Climb vs. Conventional Milling \u00b6 For the most part you always want to Climb mill. The edge of the cutter starts with a large bite and ends small, reducing work hardening and heat retention. Conventional milling Climb milling Feeds and Speeds Calculator \u00b6 I can not stress this enough, these numbers are different for every build. Only use them as a guide to find the right settings for your build. You can make a few test cuts a quickly work out how to get reliable numbers for your machine with the right settings though. https://fswizard.com/www/ Stepover \u00b6 Basic All things being equal, this is the amount of material your tool encounters in percentage of the tool diameter. The lower the percentage the lower the force on the machine, the more accurate the cut. Expanded A good thing to know is most flutes are not 50% of the diameter of the bit, usually less. Just typing in a percentage does not mean that is the actual chip load, Feedrate, RPM, and Depth of Cut all play a major part. All the numbers you enter are a fine balance of an equation giving you total chip load per tooth. Roughing is 50% or less, typically 45% depending on material density. More than 50% you will be both climb and conventional milling and should be avoided. Finishing is 20% or less depending on amount if detail and tolerances desired (I typically use 2-8% time vs. quality), ball endmills should use 10% or less to minimize scalloping. 50% stepover 25% stepover Dual EndStop Tool Changes, Z Probing \u00b6 For this method you will need the Dual EndStop firmware, an LCD, optionally a digital spindle speed controller. Starting Gcode \u00b6 The pause here is to allow you to remove the Z probe wires. G90 ; Absolute positioning, just in case G92 X0 Y0 Z0 ; Set Current position to 0, all axes G00 Z5.0000 F500 ; Raise Z 5mm at 8.3mm/s to clear clamps and screws G28 X Y Z ; Home in order, w/zprobe G92 Z0.15 ; Account for probe thickness (set your thickness) G00 Z5.0000 F500 ; Raise Z probe off off of surface M00 ; pause for LCD button press M03 S<s> ; PID, set spindle speed Tool Change \u00b6 The steppers are disabled so you can move the head to an area where you can more easily change the tool, make sure you do not let your Z axis drop onto your work surface. If you need you can insert another pause before the steppers are disabled to make sure you are there to catch it. This first pause is to let you physically change the tool and install the Z probe. The second pause is to allow you to remove the Z probe. M05 ; PID, Stop spindle G0 Z35 F500 ; Raise Z axis 35mm M84 ; Disable steppers M00 ; Wait for LCD button press ;Change tool: <n> G28 X Y Z ; Home in order, w/zprobe G92 Z0.15 ; Account for probe thickness (set your thickness) G00 Z5.0000 F500 ; Raise Z probe off off of surface M00 ; pause for LCD button press M03 S<s> ; PID, set spindle speed Ending \u00b6 Make sure you tune the final Z lift to your machine. M05 ; PID, Turn off spindle G0 Z30 ; Lift Z axis 30mm ; M84 ; Optionally turn off steppers. If you do not have a PID controller you do not have to remove or worry about the code. This is the basics, you can easily modify this. Depth of Cut \u00b6 Equal steps \u2013 Depth of cut, DOC, Should be planned for. Making equal steps will produce the best results. Just because you can cut deeper doesn\u2019t mean you should. Know the deepest you can cut your material and from there divide the cut equally. The only way to save time is less passes, if you can not save a pass make the step smaller. Equal Steps Pointless Steps Through all \u2013 Through all cuts, cuts that are intended to go all the way through the material, should move past the bottom of your material. The amount past depends on the flatness of your build, all build have some sort of variance. A 0.5mm-4mm would be pretty typical. Factor this into your equal DOC from above. Through All Post Processors \u00b6 When making Gcode from your CAM program it spits out raw coordinates, speeds, and a few other commands. A post processor simply formats in a way that your firmware will recognize it. For example, Marlin treat G0 (rapid move) and G1 (Work move) the same. Other machines set the G0 speed in the firmware, Marlin does not. To over come this we Use a line in the post processor to set the actual speed in each line so it doesn\u2019t matter. There are all sorts of things like this. All machines require a post processor. The ones we have working \u00b6 Please share your links to other PP\u2019s. I know there are more.

Once you have this clearance established and you get the rails installed squarely by measuring the diagonals and making sure they are as equal as possible. 3- X rails .

I suggest putting the outer corners into your build and measure the distance from the outer clamp loop, that gives you your Y rail lengths. 2- Squaring. Once you have the Y rails in place assemble the rollers and make sure the bolts heads do not hit the table as they move. Once you have this clearance established and you get the rails installed squarely by measuring the diagonals and making sure they are as equal as possible. 3- X rails . The X rails are \u215b\u2033 shorter than the distance between the Y rails measured at the closest point.","title":"Rail Lengths"},{"location":"zenxy/#table","text":"","title":"Table"},{"location":"zenxy/#assembly","text":"","title":"Assembly"},{"location":"zenxy/#firmware","text":"This is running coreXY belting and requires homing Y before X, as set in the firmware. You need two endstops wired Normally Closed on the X and Y. If you are facing the two steppers and looking down at them, the left one should be plugged into X the right one into Y, both plugs facing the same direction, if it does not move correctly, power down unplug and flip them both over. It is more confusing then the regular Cartesian troubleshooting.
